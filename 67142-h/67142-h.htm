</div>


<p>This story takes the adventure trail of that young
soldier-explorer Zebulon Montgomery Pike, who
was lost in the mountains of southern Colorado one
hundred years ago. Another story in the Trail
Blazers Series has told of Captains Lewis and Clark,
who explored the northwestern part of the new
Louisiana Territory. They, also, were young.
Captain Lewis had just turned thirty. But Lieutenant
and Captain Zebulon Pike was younger yet. He
was only twenty-seven when, while Lewis and Clark
were still out, he was sent to lead a handful of men
into the unknown Southwest.</p>

<p>The vast Province of Louisiana, bought by the
United States from France three years before, for
$15,000,000, was thought by the United States to
extend, in the north, from the Mississippi River to
the Rocky Mountains; in the south it tapered off
to the Gulf of Mexico at New Orleans.</p>

<p>The southwestern boundary was uncertain. The
United States claimed clear to the lower Rio Grande
River, across Texas; Spain, which had owned
Louisiana Territory before the United States bought
it from France, claimed north even to the Missouri<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
River. Some said that the Arkansas River of southern
Colorado should be the boundary, there; some
said the Red River, further south—which was confused
with the Canadian River. And when Lieutenant
Pike was started out, the United States soldiers
and the Spanish soldiers of Mexico faced each other
across the Sabine River of the western border of
Louisiana State.</p>

<p>So the trail of young Pike and his handful of
men pointed into a debated land. If the Indians
did not get them, the Spanish might. He had been
instructed not to offend the Spanish, and to keep
away from their settlements of New Mexico; but
he was resolved to stand his ground when he deemed
that he was in the right, and to defend the Flag.
The Spanish had sent six hundred soldiers, with
over two thousand horses and mules, to look for him.
He would certainly have fought them all, with his
twenty men, had they tried to stop him anywhere
outside of New Mexico.</p>

<p>No braver soldiers ever marched than Lieutenant
Pike and his little platoon. They lost their way;
they struggled with cold below zero and snow to
their waists, in the bleak high mountains. They had
left home with only summer clothing; they were
ragged and lean, and their feet froze until the bones
came out. They went days at a time without food.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
And they were utterly lost, in a winter country;
alone, one thousand miles from home.</p>

<p>But only once did a single man complain aloud.
Their wonderful leader sternly silenced him, by
reminding him that they all were sharing and
suffering alike.</p>

<p>When their lieutenant had been gone from them
two days, seeking meat to relieve a famine, at his
return he writes in his journal: “On the countenances
of the men was not a frown, nor was there
a desponding eye; all seemed happy to hail their
officer and companions; yet not a mouthful had they
eaten for four days.” Indeed, they were planning
to send out and rescue <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>It was this same spirit which made the American
soldiers in France press forward, ever forward, and
yield not an inch of ground.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pike was an officer to love as well
as to respect. He asked no favors; only obedience,
and willingness to endure what he had to endure.
He never spared himself. While others might stay
in camp, he it was that went out into the cold and
snow, hunting for meat. He made it plain that his
honor, his country and his duty were more to him
than his life. These were the three ideals that inspired
him to go on when he might have been excused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
for camping in safety and giving up his search for
the Red River.</p>

<p>The name of Pike lives in history. We have a
famous mountain named for him, and we know that
he died—“killed in action”—as a brigadier-general,
aged thirty-four. The names of his brave men have
vanished. What became of John Sparks, Pat Smith,
Jacob Carter, and the rest, we do not know. We
do not know that the Government even rescued from
the Spaniards those whom their lieutenant had been
obliged to leave. We do not know that any of them
received gifts of land and extra pay, such as the
Lewis and Clark men received. But heroes they
were, every one, who did not fail their leader nor
their flag.</p>

<p>So their company roll is printed in this book,
that they also may live again.</p>

<a href="#i_015">ZEBULON MONTGOMERY PIKE</a></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A noble young American soldier and explorer,
whose guiding purpose was: Honor, Country, Duty.</p>
</div>


<p>Born January 5, 1779, at Lamberton, near Trenton, New
Jersey.</p>

<p>His father was Captain Zebulon Pike, of the Fourth Continental
Dragoons, in the War of the Revolution; later major in
the Third and the First Regiments of Infantry, U. S. A., and
brevet lieutenant-colonel.</p>

<p>The boy Zebulon was brought up as a soldier.</p>

<p>At fifteen he was a cadet in his father’s infantry regiment
of the United States Third Sub-Legion.</p>

<p>At twenty, or in March, 1799, he was commissioned second
lieutenant in the Second Regiment of Infantry, U. S. A.</p>

<p>Commissioned first lieutenant, November, the same year.</p>

<p>Transferred to the First Infantry, of which his father was
major, in April, 1802. In this regiment Meriwether Lewis, of
the famous Lewis and Clark expedition to the mouth of the
Columbia River, was then a captain.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-six, while Captains Lewis and Clark
are exploring through the far northwest of the new Louisiana
Territory purchase, he receives orders, July 30, 1805, from
General James Wilkinson, Chief of the Army, to ascend the
Mississippi River from St. Louis to its source. He is to report
upon the country, the Indians and the fur trade of this, the
eastern border of Upper Louisiana.</p>

<p>Starts from St. Louis, August 9, 1805, with twenty enlisted
men of the regular army, in a keel-boat seventy feet long,
provisioned for four months. Suffers many hardships by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
storm, cold and hunger, but returns successful on the last day
of April, 1806, after an absence of almost nine months.</p>

<p>In less than two months, or on June 24, 1806, he is directed
to ascend the Missouri and Osage Rivers, and restore forty-six
Osage Indians, rescued by the Government from the Potawatomi
Indians, to their people of the Osage towns in western
Missouri. He is to make peace, by order of their American
father, between the Osage and the Kansas nations. He is then
to continue to the Pawnees of present northern Kansas, and ask
them to help him on to make peace with the Comanches in the
southwest on the borders of New Mexico. While with the Comanches
he is to explore the head-waters of the Arkansas and
Red (Canadian) Rivers, but he must avoid trespassing upon
the Spanish territory of New Mexico. Spanish territory is
supposed to extend south from the Red River, although the
Spanish claim that it extends much farther north, even through
Kansas.</p>

<p>Again he leaves his family, and embarks, July 15, 1806, with
First Lieutenant James B. Wilkinson, First Infantry, the son
of General Wilkinson; Civilian Surgeon John H. Robinson, an
interpreter, and eighteen enlisted men, in two boats. The majority
of the enlisted men had been with him up the Mississippi.</p>

<p>He visits the Osages, who welcome the return of their relatives,
and agree to peace with the Kansas. The Pawnees try
to stop him, by order of the Spanish, but he defies them. He
fails to find the Comanches. His march by horse and foot
takes him along the Arkansas River clear to the Rocky Mountains,
where he sights the great Pike’s Peak (later named for
him) of Colorado, and attempts to climb it. Searching for
the head of the Red River, that he may follow down to the
military posts of the United States frontier, he loses his way
completely. In the bitter cold and deep snows of a terrible
winter he crosses the front range of the Rockies, and builds a
stockade upon a stream of the Upper Rio Grande River in the
lower end of the San Luis Valley, southern Colorado.</p>

<p>Here in mid-winter Spanish soldiers from Santa Fé come
upon him and inform him that he is in Spanish territory. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
take him down to Santa Fé, the capital of the Province of New
Mexico. He is sent on down to the military headquarters at
Chihuahua, Mexico. From there he is sent to the United
States, and arrives at the American post of Natchitoches,
western Louisiana, on July 1, 1807, after travels of a year.</p>

<p>As the first Government explorer through far southwestern
Louisiana Territory he brings back much valuable information
upon the country and Indians, and upon the people, military
forces and customs of Mexico. Captains Lewis and Clark
have brought back also their information upon the far Northwest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as a reward for his services, he had been promoted
to captain, August 12, 1806.</p>

<p>Commissioned major, in the Sixth U. S. Infantry, May, 1808.</p>

<p>Commissioned lieutenant-colonel, Fourth U. S. Infantry,
December, 1809.</p>

<p>Commissioned colonel, Fifteenth U. S. Infantry, July, 1812.</p>

<p>Appointed brigadier-general, adjutant-general and inspector-general,
U. S. A., March, 1813.</p>

<p>Killed in action, April 27, 1813, while commanding the assault
by the American troops upon York, at Toronto, Canada.
The retreating British garrison blew up a powder magazine,
and a fragment of rock crushed his back. He died wrapped in
the Flag, amidst victory, at the age of only thirty-four.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I<br />
<small>THE COMING OF THE SPANIARDS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Ai-ee! I see them!” panted Iskatappe, over his
shoulder, and pointing to the west. “The Spanish!”</p>

<p>“It may be running buffalo, or a big wind,” answered
Skidi.</p>

<p>“Shall we halt and wait?” proposed Letalesha.</p>

<p>“No. It is they. It does not move fast enough
for buffalo or wind. It is on this side of the river.
We will cross the river and hide on the other side.
Then we will be safe,” ordered Iskatappe.</p>

<p>Boy Scar Head, at the rear, peered hard and he,
too, sighted a dust cloud far westward, tinging the
horizon above the rolling, sandy landscape.</p>

<p>This was the Corn month, July, 1806. The
four were travelling in single file at fast dog-trot
down through the northern end of Texas where the
Canadian River crosses. Iskatappe, or Rich Man,
led. He was second chief of the nation. Skidi, or
Wolf, came next. He was a warrior. Letalesha, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Old Knife, trotted third. He was a sub-chief. And
at the rear there trotted Scar Head, who was not yet
even a warrior, because he was just a boy; but
some day he should be a warrior, and a chief, if he
proved brave and smart.</p>

<p>They were odd-looking Indians, clad in only
moccasins and buffalo-robes. The three men had
their heads closely shaven except for a short pompadour
ridge like a rooster comb, ending in the scalp-lock.
With a paste of buffalo tallow and red clay
this scalp-lock was made to stand up stiff and curved
forward in shape of a horn. By that sign, and by
the sign of their travelling afoot, and by their tall
stature and high cheek-bones, friends and enemies
would have known them at once as Pawnees from
a nation of fierce fighters.</p>

<p>However, nobody would have taken Scar Head
for a Pawnee. He did not wear the horn—he was
not yet a warrior. He wore a red cloth band around
his head, to keep his long brown hair out of his eyes.
He was short and stocky, with a pug nose and with
freckles showing through his darkly tanned skin.
No, he did not appear to be a Pawnee, nor an Indian
at all.</p>

<p>Still, he ranked as a son of Charakterik, head
chief of the Pawnee Republic nation. Chief Charakterik
had sent him out on the warrior trail to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
experience. He was called Scar Head by reason of
the patch of white hair that grew over a queer, hot
spot on his head. He felt like an Indian and acted
like an Indian; but all he knew was that he had been
traded by the mountain Utahs to the plains Pawnees,
several years ago, and that Chief Charakterik had
adopted him.</p>

<p>The four had set out from the main Pawnee
Republic village of round mud huts on the Republican
River in present northern Kansas two weeks back.
The Pawnees always started from home on foot,
except when hunting game. They thought that they
could take care of themselves better that way. A
man on foot could hide in country where a man on
horse might be seen. But they were expected to
return on horseback, with other horses stolen or captured,
for to win horses was the test of a Pawnee
brave.</p>

<p>Scar Head hoped to learn a great deal about
horse-stealing, although this was not really a horse-stealing
scout. Nevertheless——</p>

<p>“If we are not given horses by the Spaniards,
we will get them elsewhere,” had said Rich Man.</p>

<p>“Yes; we will get them from the Spaniards,
anyway,” had replied Skidi. “They will have many
horses, easy to steal. But in order to keep friendly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
with us, they will surely give us some, when they see
we are poor and afoot.”</p>

<p>The dust cloud was welcome. It was time that
the Spaniards should be sighted—those Spanish
soldiers who, according to the report received by
Chief Charakterik, were marching from New
Mexico into the Indian country, no one knew why.
To find out was the business of the Iskatappe squad.</p>

<p>The dust cloud hung in the air, moving slowly
with the distant breeze. When finally the four
reached the bank of the river, the cloud was much
nearer.</p>

<p>“We will cross, and watch them; and to-night
we will go into their camp,” said Iskatappe.</p>

<p>So they swam and waded the shallow river, and
crawled out into a clump of willows, to wait until
the strangers should pass.</p>

<p>Soon, to the west they might see a column of
mounted figures coming on, following the course of
the river but staying back from it on account of the
deep washes, or maybe from fear that their thirsty
horses might bolt into quicksands.</p>

<p>“They are many times ten,” murmured Skidi,
counting by the fingers on his hands.</p>

<p>“It is only an advance guard,” Letalesha said.
“A bigger dust cloud is behind them.”</p>

<p>And that was so. The advance guard of horsemen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
seemed to be scouting along the river, as if seeking
a good trail to water for the others. Boy Scar
Head strained his eyes to see as much as the warriors
saw. Over the yellow desert shimmering with the
hot air the riders steadily cantered, under several
fluttering pennons borne on lances; and anybody
might tell by the way they rode that they were warriors
themselves.</p>

<p>They were going to strike the river only a short
distance below. Suddenly Skidi drew quick breath.</p>

<p>“Apaches! Look! It will be a fight.”</p>

<p>“Hi!” Iskatappe uttered. “Let nobody move.
We are safe here, if we don’t move.”</p>

<p>The scene had changed in a twinkling. A perfect
swarm of Indians had burst from the very ground
out there, and with shrill yells were racing to hem
the Spanish between them and the river. How they
had hidden themselves so well was remarkable, but
it was an Indian trick and these were Apaches, who
knew how to hide in the sand itself.</p>

<p>They outnumbered the Spanish three to one.
The Spanish leader rapidly formed his column—he
rode a white horse, the horses of his men were dark.
On charged the Apaches, whooping and brandishing
their bows and lances, as if they did not intend to
stop until they had ridden right over the enemy;
when on a sudden the guns of the Spanish puffed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
white smoke. Instantly every Apache fell to hang
on the side of his horse; and back and forth they
all scurried, shooting with their bows. The arrow
stems glinted in the sun like streaks of hail.</p>

<p>“That is a good chief,” Iskatappe praised. “He
knows how to fight.”</p>

<p>For the Apache chief had ordered half his men
to dismount, and turn their horses loose. The other
half stayed in the saddle. They charged, with the
footmen running behind; the Spanish horsemen
charged to meet them; then the Apache horsemen
separated to right and left and the footmen volleyed
with arrows.</p>

<p>This made the Spanish halt, to answer with guns.
The Apache footmen darted back, behind their
horsemen, and these charged again, to lure the
Spanish on into bow-shot.</p>

<p>Boy Scar Head quivered with excitement. It
was the first real battle that he remembered to have
seen. The others were tense, too, and staring
eagerly.</p>

<p>“With half that number of Pawnees I would eat
those Spanish up,” Skidi boasted. “We all would
take scalps and horses and be rich.”</p>

<p>“Those Spanish have guns and much powder
and lead,” replied Old Knife. “It is hard to fight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
guns with bows. But one big charge, and all would
be over.”</p>

<p>The battle slowly traveled. It was getting
directly opposite, as the Apaches gradually gave
ground and the Spanish took ground. Scarcely
anybody appeared to have been hurt yet; there were
no dead on the sand and all the wounded stayed
in their saddles. The column in the distance was
making a larger dust, as if hastening to the rescue.</p>

<p>The Apaches no doubt knew this. Now on a
sudden the noise quieted. The Apache chief had
cantered forward from among his men, shaking his
lance. He was a very heavy man, with a very long
lance; upon his arm was a red shield. He rode a
fine spotted horse.</p>

<p>“The chiefs will fight, maybe,” quoth Letalesha.
“That is the way to settle it.”</p>

<p>The Apache chief spoke in a loud voice, holding
his lance high; but the Spanish chief on the white
horse waved him back and evidently said no.</p>

<p>“The Spanish chief is a coward,” Skidi asserted.
“He has a small heart.”</p>

<p>“Why should he risk losing his scalp, when he
is winning and he has enough men coming to burn
the Apaches like dry grass?” argued the wise Old
Knife.</p>

<p>The Apache chief sat a moment, waiting; then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
he turned back for his own party. From the Spanish
a great shout arose, that made him again turn,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Ai-ee! It will be a fight, man to man, after
all!” Iskatappe exclaimed.</p>

<p>A Spanish soldier had dashed past his chief,
and was galloping into the clear, flourishing his
sword. It was a challenge. The chief sped to meet
him. They both crouched behind their round shields.
A moment—and they came together. The Spanish
horseman thrust his shield forward, to throw aside
the chief’s lance point. But he did not catch it full.
He only threw it higher, so that it glanced on and
struck him in the throat—went straight through.
He fell off, backward. Jerking the lance out, the
Apache chief scoured by, in a half circle, with a
whoop of victory.</p>

<p>“Hi, yi!” Old Knife grunted. “There is blood
and a scalp.”</p>

<p>What a yell broke from the Apaches and the
Spaniards both—a yell of triumph from the one, a
yell of vengeance from the others! The Spanish
charged, firing their guns, to save the scalp, and to
kill. The Apaches scattered; their chief galloped
hither-thither, urging them to stand, but they had
no stomachs for more fighting at close quarters and
the rest of the Spanish were spurring in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>Presently all the Apaches, the footmen on horse
again, tore away, making down the river. Without
trying to pursue them the whole Spanish army gathered
on the battlefield. They were too heavily
clothed to overtake Indians.</p>

<p>“They are as many as a herd of buffalo,” said
Letalesha. “They are a large war party. Where
are they going and what do they want?”</p>

<p>“We shall find out from them at sundown,”
Rich Man answered. “We will let them camp,
first. They are blood hungry now, and very mad.”</p>

<p>“It will be no trouble for us to get horses,”
laughed Wolf. “Even a boy like Scar Head could
steal some.”</p>

<p>“Will you let me try?” Scar Head asked, hopefully.</p>

<p>“You shall be a warrior and get horses,” Iskatappe
promised, “unless they make us presents of
them.”</p>

<p>“The Apache chief was Big Thunder,” Old
Knife declared. “I know him. Red is his medicine,
and as long as he carries that red shield nothing
can kill him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the Spanish chief knew, too,” Wolf
proposed. “Of course, nobody wishes to fight
against medicine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>“The Spanish soldier’s medicine was very weak,”
remarked Iskatappe.</p>

<p>Thus they chatted, waiting and watching. Pretty
soon the Spanish, also, moved on, down river.
There were at least six hundred of them, all mounted,
and twice that number of unsaddled horses and
mules, some packed with supplies. To jingle of
trappings and murmur of voices they proceeded, in
a long column. Rich Man, Old Knife, Wolf and
Boy Scar Head followed, by the other river bank,
keeping out of sight in the brush and hollows.</p>

<p>At sunset the Spanish halted to form camp,
beside the river.</p>

<p>“We had better go in before dark,” Rich Man
directed. “Or they might shoot at us. We had
better go in while their pots are full, for my belly
is empty.”</p>

<p>So they rose boldly from their covert under the
bank of the river, and crossed for the Spanish camp,
their buffalo-robes tightly about them.</p>

<p>The camp was spread out in a circle over a wide
area. Several chiefs’ lodges had been set up, countless
fires were smoking, horses whinnied, mules
brayed, medicine pipes (horns) tooted, and a myriad
of figures moved busily, getting water, going on
herd, arranging the packs, marching to and fro as
if in a dance, or clustering around the fires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>These were the Spanish, were they, from the
south? Scar Head had not supposed that so many
could come so far, all together. The nation of the
Spanish must be a great and powerful nation.</p>

<p>A guard saw the Iskatappe file approaching. He
shouted warning of them, and leveled his gun.</p>

<p>Iskatappe lifted his hand in the peace sign.</p>

<p>“Amigos—friends,” he called. He knew a little
Spanish. So did most of the Pawnees—a little
Spanish picked up from the Comanches and southern
Utahs, and a little French picked up from the St.
Louis traders who visited the Pawnee country.</p>

<p>“Qué tiene—what do you want?” the guard
demanded, stopping them with his gun. He was
dressed in a blue cloth hunting-shirt with red trimmings,
and leather wrappings upon his legs, and huge
loose-topped leather moccasins reaching to his knees,
and a broad-brimmed high-crowned hat with ribbons
on it; and all his face was covered with bushy
black hair. He was armed with a short-barreled gun,
and a long knife in a scabbard. He certainly looked
like a stout warrior.</p>

<p>“El capitan,” Iskatappe replied, meaning that
he wished to see the chief.</p>

<p>Other Spanish soldiers came running. Their
head warrior said: “Come,” and with the Iskatappe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
file stalking proudly after he led the way through the
staring camp to the lodge of the chief.</p>

<p>He was a black-eyed, dark-skinned, slim young
war chief, splendidly clad in those same high, loose-topped
shiny leather moccasins, and a bright red
cloak flowing to his knees, and a hat turned up at
one side and sparkling with gilt.</p>

<p>Of course the first thing to do was to eat. Therefore,
after shaking hands with the Spanish war
chief, Rich Man, Old Knife and Wolf sat down;
boy Scar Head sat down likewise. They were served
with plenty of meat, from a pot.</p>

<p>Gazing curiously about, Scar Head might see
indeed that these Spanish were rich and powerful.
Such quantities of horses and mules, of saddles,
arms, supplies, and soldiers warmly dressed, and
fiercely whiskered not only with hair on cheeks and
chin, but sticking out like horns on either side of the
nose! What did the Spanish wish?</p>

<p>Having eaten, Iskatappe began to find out. The
Spanish chief filled a pipe and passed it out; Rich
Man, Old Knife and Wolf smoked each a few puffs,
the Spanish chief smoked a few puffs, and Iskatappe
spoke.</p>

<p>“The Pawnee wish to know why their Spanish
father is sending so many of his soldiers into the
buffalo country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>“The great king who owns all this country is
anxious to be friendly with his children,” responded
the young war chief. “So he has sent me, his lieutenant,
Don Facundo Melgares, with a guard, to
march through, take his red children by the hand,
give them presents, and make the chain of friendship
stronger.”</p>

<p>“That is good,” said Iskatappe. “The Pawnee
Republic is very poor. But if my father is sending
presents to the Pawnee, why are his men marching
east instead of north? And why does he send so
many soldiers with guns?”</p>

<p>“We follow a long trail,” explained the war
chief. “There are Indians of bad hearts toward
everybody, like the Apaches; and the Apaches we
will punish. The great king knows how to punish
his enemies, as well as how to reward his friends.
We are marching east because we go first to visit the
Comanches. We bear gifts and friendship to the
Comanches, to the Pawnees, and to the Kansas.
And we march east to clean the country from the
Americans who are stealing in. The great king
will look after his own children. He wishes no foreigners
to view the land. He will not permit the
American traders to cheat the Indians. The American
king pretends to have bought part of the country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
but he has no rights here in the south, and the
great king of Spain still owns all the lands beyond
the Pawnees and the Kansas. Now word has come
to the Spanish governor that the Americans are
sending soldiers westward through Spanish country,
to spy out the land. They are led by a chief named
Pike. So we march ready for battle, to meet these
Americans and either turn them back or take them
prisoner.”</p>

<p>“The Americans of Chief Pike will fight?”
asked Iskatappe.</p>

<p>The young war chief laughed, showing white
teeth.</p>

<p>“They cannot fight the soldiers of the great king.
We are many and brave; the Americans are small.
We can punish or reward. The Americans are weak
and poor. Should there be war, we will eat them
up. If they do not keep out of the country, there
will be war. We shall warn them. The Indians
would do very foolishly to help the Americans who
have nothing, and are only greedy, seeking to steal
the Indians’ hunting grounds. First a few will
come, as spies; then more will come by the same
trail, and with their guns kill all the buffalo.”</p>

<p>“We know little about the Americans, but we
see that the Spanish are many and strong,” Iskatappe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
replied. “I will take word back to the Pawnee,
about this Pike.”</p>

<p>“Who is your head chief?”</p>

<p>“He is Charakterik—White Wolf.”</p>

<p>“Where does he live?”</p>

<p>“In his town of the Pawnee nation on the river
of the Pawnee Republic.”</p>

<p>“Tell him that after we have marched east and
talked with the Comanches and cleaned the foreign
traders from the country, we will march north and
visit him at his town on the River Republican. If
the American chief Mungo-Meri Pike comes there,
the Pawnees must stop him; for the great king will
be angry if the Americans are allowed to pass
through.”</p>

<p>“I will tell him,” Iskatappe promised. “It is
best that we travel fast. We came down on foot,
for we are very poor. If we have horses to ride
back on, we shall travel faster.”</p>

<p>“Bueno—good,” answered the Spanish chief.
“Your father the great king of us all is generous
to his children. You shall have horses, so that
you may carry the news quickly.”</p>

<p>This night the Iskatappe squad slept in the Spanish
camp, and ate frequently. Rich Man explained
to Old Knife and Wolf what had been said to him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
and not understood by them. Boy Scar Head listened.
In the morning they were treated to a marching
dance, in which the Spanish soldiers moved to
the beat of drums. They were presented with a
horse apiece; and after having shaken hands again
they left, well satisfied.</p>

<p>Once away from the river they rode fast; for
Skidi had stolen three mules during the night while
the guard was sleepy instead of watchful, and hidden
the animals in a convenient place. But the Spanish
did not pursue.</p>

<p>“We will tell Charakterik that the Spanish are
strong,” said Iskatappe. “They fought the Apaches;
they have plenty of guns and horses. They will eat
the Americans of that Pike.”</p>

<p>“I think, myself, that the Pawnee will grow
fatter by helping the Spanish father than by helping
the strange American father,” declared Old Knife.</p>

<p>“We have gained four horses and three mules,”
Skidi chuckled. “All the whites are stupid. If the
Americans come they will go back afoot; hey?”</p>

<p>“What kind of men are the Americans?” Boy
Scar Head ventured to ask, from the rear.</p>

<p>“We are talking,” Letalesha rebuked. “When
chiefs and warriors talk, boys keep silent.”</p>

<p>So Scar Head got no information. All he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
knew was, that the Americans were a white nation
living in the far east, beyond St. Louis where the
French traders lived. But three Pawnees had been
taken by the great trader Pierre Chouteau, to visit
the American father in Wash’ton. When they returned,
the Pawnees would know more about the
Americans. And of course that Chief Pike was
likely to appear if the Spanish did not stop him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II<br />
<small>THE COMING OF THE AMERICANS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Spanish came in about three weeks—three
hundred of them, led by their young war chief whose
name was Melgares. A brave sight they made as
they rode with flags and drums and jingle of bridles
and formed camp outside the Chief Charakterik
town.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Melgares held a council with the
Republican Pawnees and the Grand Pawnees from
the north. The Pawnee Loups, or Wolf Pawnees,
did not send any chiefs, because they were at war
with the other Pawnees.</p>

<p>The Spanish chief said that he had met the
Ietans or Comanches in the south and signed a treaty
of peace with them. They had promised to help
their Spanish father. But on the way north the
Omahas had stolen many of his horses and mules,
after another council; and by reason of these bad
hearts he had come on with only a few of his men,
in order to smooth the road between the great king
and the great king’s children.</p>

<p>He was too young to sit in grand council with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
the head chiefs of the Pawnees. In the spring a
higher chief than he would come, to build a town
near the Pawnee town, and live with the red people
and teach them how to get rich, if they were good.
Meanwhile they must watch out that the Americans
(who were poor but greedy) did not sneak in, and
cheat them of their lands and drive off the game.
The American chief, Mungo-Meri Pike, was on the
way, although he had not been found. If he arrived,
he must be turned back. These were the orders of
the king of the Spanish nation, who ruled all this
country.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Melgares gave Chief Charakterik and
the head chief of the Grand Pawnees each a large,
fine medal of silver to wear; and a paper signed by
the governor of New Mexico, which made them head
men under the king; and a Spanish flag, and four
mules. He laid on the prairie other gifts, of crimson
cloth and of tobacco and smaller medals; and again
warning them that the great king would be very
angry if the crafty Americans were permitted to
pass, he rode away south, with all his men.</p>

<p>Chief Charakterik hung the gay Spanish flag of
red and yellow in front of the council lodge, as a sign
for everybody to see. It was plain to him also that
the Spanish nation was a powerful nation, to send so
many soldiers so far, looking for the Americans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>The Spanish soldiers had not been gone long
when from the Osage towns in the southeast toward
the Missouri River there ran the news that the
Americans of Mungo-Meri Pike were coming indeed.
They were bringing to the Osages almost fifty men
and women whom the Potawatomis had captured
last year, and who had been rescued by the American
father. Two of the Pawnees who had been to
Wash’ton visiting the American father were with
them on the way home.</p>

<p>“We will let them come this far, so as to get
our brothers back,” said Chief Charakterik. “We
will talk with them and see what kind of men they
are, but they shall go no farther.”</p>

<p>He sent Pawnee scouts down to the Osage towns,
to watch the Americans.</p>

<p>Now August, the squash month, had passed,
and September, the month when the buffalo fatten,
had opened. The Americans were reported to be
at the Osage villages, where a welcome had greeted
the Osages returned from the Potawatomis, and a
great council had been held with the Pike men.</p>

<p>They had traveled in boats up the Osage River
from the Missouri, but were coming on across country
to the Pawnees by horses.</p>

<p>Only one American appeared, first, riding in
with a Pawnee-who-had-been-to-Wash’ton as his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
guide. This Pawnee young man had gone to visit
the American father many moons ago, and here he
was again, safe and sound and wearing good clothes.
That spoke well for the Americans.</p>

<p>He said that the other Pawnee-who-had-been-to-Wash’ton
was coming with the rest of the Americans.
They were bringing several Osages to smoke
with the Pawnees. They had sent word for the
Kansas to meet them and smoke peace. The Americans
were a pleasant people; they numbered thousands.
This American with him was a medicine-man
who cured diseases. The American chief, Pike, had
given the Osages all the rescued captives and had
asked nothing except peace and a chance to buy
horses; he had presents for the Pawnees, too, and
was going to the Comanches. His men were few
although well armed.</p>

<p>The next day, after having talked with the
American medicine-man in the lodge, Chief Charakterik
took sixty warriors and rode out to meet Chief
Mungo-Meri Pike.</p>

<p>Charakterik was gone three days, and came in
without having sighted the Americans. But a Pawnee
hunter reported that the Americans were farther
to the southward; so Chief Charakterik sent out
Frank (which was the American name of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Pawnee-who-had-been-to-Wash’ton) and three other
warriors, to find them.</p>

<p>On the second morning two of the scouts galloped
back into town.</p>

<p>“The Pike Americans are nearing. They will
be here before noon.”</p>

<p>“Tell them to wait until I shall meet them and
smoke with them,” Chief Charakterik ordered.</p>

<p>All the warriors were arrayed, dressed in their
best robes and blankets, and painted with the Pawnee
colors of white, yellow, blue and black. Chief
Charakterik wore his large Spanish medal and finest
white buffalo-robe. Second Chief Iskatappe wore
a red coat given him by his Spanish father.</p>

<p>Three hundred warriors left the village, with the
chiefs. Riding in their midst, as the son of a great
chief Scar Head felt that the Pawnees need fear
nobody.</p>

<p>The Americans had halted about three miles out,
just at the other side of a ridge. The Osages were
sitting in front of them. Chief Charakterik shouted
and waved his hand—the Pawnee warriors divided
right and left and swooped down at dead run, yelling
and firing their guns. The Americans stood firm,
not afraid, as if they knew that this was only play.
They were few, as said; scarcely more than the
fingers on two hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>After the warriors had charged and had formed
a circle, Chief Charakterik and Second Chief Iskatappe
advanced on foot to shake hands with the
American chief. This Mungo-Meri Pike was a
young man, in a long hunting-shirt or coat of blue
with brass buttons and high standing collar and
lighter blue facings; on his head there was a three-cornered
hat; a curved sword was at his side and
leather moccasins reached to his knees. He was
redder than the Spanish chief Melgares, and had
no hair on his face.</p>

<p>His men were armed with guns that ended in
sharp-pointed knives, but their clothing was thin
and poor—nothing like the rich clothing of the
Spanish soldiers. They had a flag of red and white
stripes and a starry blue square in one corner, but
they were small in number; and all in all they did not
cut much of a figure when compared with the Spanish.
Certainly they were either brave or foolish,
thought Boy Scar Head as he roundly stared, to
dare the Spanish and the Indians in such fashion.</p>

<p>The Osages knew how to act when in Pawnee
country. Their chief stood up and offered Chief
White Wolf a pipe. They smoked, as sign of peace.
Then at a signal by White Wolf, he and Mungo-Meri
Pike and the American second chief (also a
young man) rode on for the village. An American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
head warrior on a white horse rode just behind,
carrying the American flag. The Osages and the
other Americans followed, while the Pawnee warriors
raced back and forth alongside, whooping and
showing off. It was great fun.</p>

<p>When they all had crossed the ridge and were
near the town, another halt was ordered, in order to
smoke horses with the Osages. The four Osages
sat down together; Chief Charakterik sat down in
front of them, and lighted his pipe. Any Pawnee
who wished to give horses to an Osage took the
pipe and passed it to the Osage. Every time it was
passed it meant a horse, until eight horses had been
given. This was the Horse Smoke.</p>

<p>The American second chief marched the soldiers
on, to make camp up-river from the town. Chief
Mungo-Meri Pike and his medicine-man stayed for
a talk with White Wolf in his lodge. They were
feasted to stewed corn and squash.</p>

<p>The Osages also were feasted in the village.
They had come on with the Americans to meet the
Kansas at the Pawnee village and sit in peace council.
Pretty Bird was their head chief.</p>

<p>Everybody was curious to learn from the Osages
and from the two Pawnee-who-had-been-to-Wash’ton
what kind of people these Americans were.</p>

<p>“They live in a country wider than a week’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
travel by horse,” Frank asserted. “You are never
out of sight of their lodges.”</p>

<p>“Their women have red cheeks, and their men
are in number of the buffalo,” the other Pawnee
asserted. “They have great guns that shoot a mile
and speak twice.”</p>

<p>“If they are so powerful and many, why do
they send such a little company into this country,
when the Spanish father sent half a thousand soldiers
at once?” inquired Skidi. “These are spies.”</p>

<p>“They brought us forty-six of our relatives,
from the Potawatomi,” said an Osage. “They asked
for horses to go on with, but we sold them few.
Now by orders of the great father at Wash’ton we
are to make peace with the Kansas. The great father
wishes his red children to fight no more.”</p>

<p>“It is all because there is talk of war between the
Spanish and the Americans,” Frank wisely declared.
“That we heard. The Americans wish to keep the
Indians from the war trail, so that they can march
in here and take the land.”</p>

<p>“We do not want the Americans in here,” spoke
Skidi. “Our Spanish father warned us against them.
They are poor and stingy or they would have sent
a large company and an old chief to treat with us.
They will get no help from the Pawnee, and they
must go back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>The American chief and his medicine-man stayed
a long time in the Charakterik lodge. After a while
Scar Head’s older brother came looking for him.</p>

<p>“White Wolf says that you are to go on with
the two Americans up to their camp and take a pony
load of corn.”</p>

<p>“How soon?”</p>

<p>“Now. They are leaving. The pony is being
packed.”</p>

<p>So Scar Head hastened to the lodge. The two
Americans were bidding Chief Charakterik goodby,
and were about to mount their horses. The chief
beckoned to Scar Head and pointed to the pony.
Scar Head obediently scrambled atop the corn.</p>

<p>“Do I come back to-night?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You may stay till morning, and see what you
can see. Do not talk; and be sure and bring back
the pony.”</p>

<p>This was quite an adventure—to ride to the
American camp with the head chief and the medicine-man,
and maybe spend the night there. Scar Head’s
heart beat rapidly, but he did not show that he was
either frightened or delighted, for he was Indian,
and son of White Wolf.</p>

<p>He guided his loaded pony in the rear of the two
trotting horsemen. Outside the town Chief Mungo-Meri<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Pike reined in and dropped back beside him,
with a smile.</p>

<p>They eyed each other, although Scar Head did
not smile. He was not ready to smile, and White
Wolf had told him not to talk.</p>

<p>The American chief had a clear pink and brown
skin and a bright blue eye, with rather large nose
and mouth, and stubborn chin. His manner was
quick and commanding; anybody might see that he
was a chief.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” he asked, suddenly, in
French.</p>

<p>“Scar Head,” answered Scar Head, in Pawnee.</p>

<p>Evidently the American chief did not understand
Pawnee, for he looked a little puzzled.</p>

<p>“Do you speak French?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes, little,” answered Scar Head.</p>

<p>“You are not an Indian?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Pawnee,” grunted Scar Head.</p>

<p>“You don’t look like a Pawnee.”</p>

<p>“Pawnee,” Scar Head insisted, as he had been
ordered always to do, by Charakterik.</p>

<p>“Who is your father?”</p>

<p>“White Wolf.”</p>

<p>“Who was your mother?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Were you born here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Do you speak English?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>Scar Head held up the fingers of his two hands;
that was as nearly as he could guess. It didn’t
matter, anyway.</p>

<p>The American chief hailed the medicine-man in
the American language. Scar Head did not understand,
but the words were: “Doctor, I don’t believe
this is an Indian boy at all.”</p>

<p>Now the medicine-man (he was a young man,
with brown hair on his face) reined back to ride
upon Scar Head’s other side. He spoke, in French.</p>

<p>“Are you an Indian?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What nation?”</p>

<p>“Pawnee.”</p>

<p>“Where did the Pawnee get you?”</p>

<p>“From Utahs.”</p>

<p>“Chief Charakterik is not your father, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes. My father.”</p>

<p>“Your mother a Utah?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know.”</p>

<p>“How long has Charakterik been your father?”
The medicine-man was smart.</p>

<p>“Two year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“I see. The Utahs probably traded him to the
Pawnees, doctor,” spoke the chief Mungo-Meri Pike,
across, in the language that Scar Head did not understand.
“And Charakterik adopted him.”</p>

<p>“The Utahs must have got him somewhere.
He’s no Indian,” replied the medicine-man, in those
strange words. “He’s not Spanish, either.” And
he asked, in French, of Scar Head:</p>

<p>“You speak Spanish?”</p>

<p>“A little.”</p>

<p>“You speak Utah?”</p>

<p>Scar Head nodded. He was growing tired of
these questionings.</p>

<p>The medicine-man kept eyeing him.</p>

<p>“Where did you get this?” And he tapped
his own head, in sign of the patch of white hair.</p>

<p>“My name,” answered Scar Head.</p>

<p>“What made it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Did the Utahs capture you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Where were you before the Utahs had you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know.”</p>

<p>“He may not be all Indian, but he’s enough
Indian so he won’t tell what he doesn’t want to tell,”
laughed the American chief, in the strange words.</p>

<p>The medicine-man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“I’d like to take him along with us and find
out more about him. By the shape of his head
he’s white blood.”</p>

<p>The three jogged on in silence. Scar Head wondered
what they had said, with those words, but he
was glad to be let alone. White Wolf had forbidden
him to talk with strangers. Nevertheless he
glanced now and then at the two Americans. He
felt more friendly toward them. They seemed kind.</p>

<p>The American camp was not far. It had guards
stationed, who saluted the American chief when he
passed. At his lodge fire he halted; a head warrior
took Scar Head’s pony, with the corn; other warriors
took the two horses, to lead them away. The
American second chief was here. While he and
Chief Mungo-Meri Pike talked, Scar Head sat by
the fire and looked around, to see what was going on.</p>

<p>The camp had been placed upon a hill for protection.
There were only four or five lodges, of
canvas, besides the chief’s lodge. The American
flag was flying from a pole. This American camp
appeared poor—nothing. The soldiers, fifteen, wore
shabby uniforms of sky blue; their coats were short
and tight, their leggins thin, and several were
mending their moccasins of heavy leather. They
had only fifteen extra horses, to carry their baggage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
and the presents. There was a black dog.
They talked and laughed much, as they busied themselves
or waited around the two fires that they had
built. The hair on their heads was of different
colors—brown, and black, and red, and gray. So
was the hair on their faces. They were quick, active
warriors—good men, evidently. If the Pawnees
fought them, it would be hot work before they all
were wiped out.</p>

<p>Maybe, thought Scar Head, they depended upon
the medicine of their “doctor,” to help them.</p>

<p>Another man, who could talk sign language and
a little Pawnee, came and sat down beside him.
He was the interpreter for Chief Pike.</p>

<p>“You’re no Indian; you’re white,” he accused,
of Scar Head.</p>

<p>“Indian,” said Scar Head.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“Utahs.”</p>

<p>“Where did they get you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Did White Wolf buy you from the Utahs?”</p>

<p>“He is my father.”</p>

<p>“You speak with crooked tongue,” the interpreter
accused. “You are white. You are American.
Who was your father?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“White Wolf is my father. I am Pawnee. I
will talk no more,” said Scar Head. “Let me
alone.”</p>

<p>After that nobody bothered him, although they
all eyed him. Why did they tell him that he was
white? Did he wish to be white? Why should he
be white, or American, when the Pawnee were a
great people who could fight even the Padoucah—the
Comanches or Ietans as they were called. And
if one were white instead of red, it would be better
to be Spanish, for the Spanish were rich and powerful,
and their king owned the country.</p>

<p>Yet—yet, Scar Head could not help but admit
that these Americans bore themselves like warriors;
this Pike must be a bold young chief, to come so
far with so few men; and after all, perhaps the
Americans might prove strong in medicine. The
Osages and the two Pawnee-who-had-been-to-Wash’ton
spoke well of the nation.</p>

<p>The medicine-man approached him and suddenly
laid fingers upon his white patch, and pressed.</p>

<p>“Does that hurt?”</p>

<p>Scar Head tried not to wince, for hurt it did.
He squirmed free.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>The medicine-man might be putting an evil spell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
upon him, to change him to white; but the medicine-man
only smiled, and left him.</p>

<p>Having eaten of meat and corn, Scar Head slept
in the chief’s lodge, with the chief himself and the
medicine-man whose title was “doctor.” When he
awakened in the morning he was safe and sound still.</p>

<small>THE PAWNEES ARE OF TWO MINDS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“The Kansas are coming! They come in peace,
but make ready for them.”</p>

<p>These were the words of the heralds shouting
through the great town of the Pawnee Republic.
Scar Head heard. He had returned this morning
from the American camp with the interpreter (whose
name was Baroney), and felt rather important as
the other boys curiously questioned him. To Chief
White Wolf he had only good to report of the
Americans. They had treated him well, aside from
bothering him with talk about himself; but he had
told them little. The fact was, he did not know
much that he could tell!</p>

<p>Baroney had wished to trade for provisions and
horses. Now it was afternoon, and new excitement
arose. The Kansas were coming! A peace party
of them had halted, out on the prairie, and had sent
in one man to announce them. They had come
by order of the American father, to smoke peace
with the Osages.</p>

<p>The Osages and the Kansas had long been bitter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
enemies; the Pawnees, too, had lost many scalps to
the Kansas, although just at present there was no
war between them.</p>

<p>So Chief Charakterik directed that the Kansas
be well received and feasted. Baroney the American
interpreter took word up to the Pike camp that
the Kansas were waiting.</p>

<p>The two American chiefs exchanged visits with
Chiefs White Wolf and Rich Man, and the Kansas
chiefs. In a council held the next day the Kansas
principal chief, Wah-on-son-gay, and his sub-chiefs,
and the Osage principal chief, Shin-ga-wa-sa or
Pretty Bird, and his sub-chiefs, agreed upon paper
that the nations of the Kansas and the Osage should
be friends, according to the wish of their American
father.</p>

<p>Wolf, the Pawnee, laughed.</p>

<p>“It will last only until spring,” he said. “Nobody
can trust the Kansas; and as for those Osage,
they are getting to be a nation of squaws. One-half
their face is red, the other half is white. We Pawnee
are all red. We are not afraid of the Kansas, and
we shall not help the Americans. They are a small
people of small hearts, as the Spanish chief said.”</p>

<p>This might appear to be the truth. Chief Charakterik
was of the same opinion. He and Second
Chief Iskatappe and two sub-chiefs had been invited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
to a feast by the American chiefs. When they
returned they were scornful, although White Wolf
had been given a gun with two barrels, an arm band,
and other things, and the other chiefs also had been
rewarded.</p>

<p>Scar Head heard Rich Man tell about it.</p>

<p>“Charakterik wore his large medal given him
by the young Spanish chief. They did not ask him
to take it off. They offered me a little American
medal. ‘What shall I do with that?’ I asked. ‘It
is not a medal for a chief. Those two young warriors
who have been to Wash’ton were given bigger medals
than this. Let the American father send me a
chief’s medal, for I can get Spanish medals. I
am not a boy.’ Yes,” continued Iskatappe, “the
American nation must be very mean and stingy.
They send a young man and a few soldiers, with
little medals and a few poor presents, to talk with
the great Pawnee nation. But the Spanish asked us
to wait until next spring, when they will send us a
principal chief and many more soldiers, to live near
us and treat with us in honorable fashion.”</p>

<p>The council with the Americans had been set
for the next day. The two American chiefs, and
Baroney the interpreter, and the “doctor,” and a
guard of soldiers, rode down. Chief Charakterik
assembled four hundred warriors. The council lodge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
was crowded, and a throng of women and boys and
girls pressed around, outside, to peer and listen.
Scar Head managed to squeeze inside, to a place
where he might see and hear. The Osages and the
Kansas were inside, too.</p>

<p>After the pipe had been passed around among
the chiefs, Mungo-Meri Pike stood, to speak. He
threw off his red-lined blue cloak, and stood slim
and straight—a handsome young man.</p>

<p>Baroney translated for him, in Pawnee and sign
language.</p>

<p>“The great American father of us all, at Wash’ton,
has sent me,” he said. “He is now your father.
You have no Spanish father. Not long ago the
Spanish gave up all this country, from the big river
to the mountains. The Americans have bought it.
The Spanish have no rights here, any more. Now
your American father has sent me to visit among
his red children, to tell them that his heart is good
toward them, and that he wishes peace. I am to
take back word of them, and of the country, so that
he may know. I am surprised to see that you are
flying the Spanish flag at the lodge door. <a href="#i_055">I bring
you the American flag</a>, to take its place. You cannot
have two fathers and two flags. I have also
brought you gifts. They are here. I ask you to
accept them, as a small token from your American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
father. I should like your answer.” And he sat
down.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_055">
  <img src="images/i_055.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_55">“I BRING YOU THE AMERICAN FLAG”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Chief Charakterik dropped his buffalo-robe from
his shoulders, to stand and speak.</p>

<p>“We hear your words,” he said. “We thank
you for the presents. We wish to ask where you
are going from here?”</p>

<p>“We are going on, to explore the country and
to smoke peace with the Ietans,” replied Chief Pike.</p>

<p>“We knew that you were coming,” spoke White
Wolf. “The Spanish chief who was here said that
you were coming. He said that the Americans were
a small nation but greedy, and that soon they would
stretch out even to the Pawnee, and claim the country.
Now we see how truly the Spanish chief saw
ahead, for here you are. We do not wish you to go
on. We turned the Spanish back, until they should
come again to live with us. We will turn you back.
It is impossible for you to go on. You are few
and you do not know the country. The Padoucah
(Comanches) are many and powerful. They are
our enemies and the friends of the Spanish and will
kill you all. You must go back by the road that you
came on.”</p>

<p>The young Chief Mungo-Meri Pike stood up
straighter still, and answered with ringing voice.</p>

<p>“I have been sent out by our great father to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
travel through his country, to visit his red children,
and talk peace. You have seen how I have
brought the Osages and the Kansas together. I
wish my road to be smooth, with a blue sky over my
head. I have not seen any blood in the trail. But
the warriors of the American father are not women,
to be turned back by words. If the Pawnee wish to
try to stop me, they may try. We are men, well
armed, and will take many lives in exchange for
our own. Then the great father will send other
warriors, to gather our bones and to avenge our
deaths, and our spirits will hear war-songs sung in
praise of our deeds. We shall go on. I ask you
for horses, and somebody who speaks Comanche,
to help us; and I ask you to take down the Spanish
flag and hoist the flag of your American father,
instead.”</p>

<p>That was a defiant speech, and Scar Head thrilled.
Surely, the American chief was a man.</p>

<p>Iskatappe arose.</p>

<p>“We do not want peace with the Padoucah,” he
said. “They have killed six of our young men.
We must have scalps in payment, so that the young
men’s relatives can wash the mourning paint from
their faces and be happy. It would be foolish for
us to send anybody with you or to give you horses.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
We have been satisfied with our Spanish father. We
do not wish so many fathers.”</p>

<p>He sat down.</p>

<p>“That is true,” Chief Pike retorted. “You do
not wish many fathers. Now you have only the one
great father. He is your American father. You
have not answered me about the flag. I still see the
Spanish flag flying at your door. I think you ought
to lower that flag and put up this American flag,
for I have told you that the Spanish do not rule this
land any more. You cannot be children of two
fathers, and speak with two tongues. I wish an
answer.”</p>

<p>Nobody said anything for a long time. The
American chiefs sat there, gazing straight in front
of them, and waiting. The blue eyes of Mungo-Meri
Pike seemed to search all hearts. Was it to be
peace or war? Then old Sleeping Bear, the head
councillor of the Pawnee Republic, got up, without
a word, and went to the doorway, and took down
the Spanish flag from its staff, and brought it to
Chief Pike. Chief Pike handed him the American
flag, of red and white stripes like the sunset and the
starry sky in one corner. Old Sleeping Bear carried
it and fastened it to the staff.</p>

<p>The Osages and the Kansas grunted “Good,”
because they already had accepted the American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
father; but the Pawnees hung their heads and looked
glum. When the Spanish came back and found
their great king’s flag gone, what would they say?</p>

<p>Chief Pike saw the downcast faces, and read
the thoughts behind them. His heart was big, after
all, and he did not wish to shame the Pawnee nation,
for he uttered, quickly:</p>

<p>“You have shown me that you are of good mind
toward your father in Wash’ton. I do not seek to
make trouble between you and the Spanish. We
will attend to the Spanish. Should there be war
between the white people, the wish of your American
father is that his red children stay by their own fires
and not take part. In case that the Spanish come
and demand their flag, here it is. I give it to you.
I ask that you do not put it up while I am with you,
but that you keep the American flag flying.”</p>

<p>“We thank you. We will do as you say,” White
Wolf responded; and every face had brightened.
“In return, we beg you not to go on. You will
lose your way. It will soon be winter, and you have
no winter clothes, I see. The Spanish will capture
you. If they do not capture you, the Padoucah
will kill you. It will be pitiful.”</p>

<p>Soon after this the council broke up. Chief
Mungo-Meri Pike was still determined; he had not
been frightened by the words. His men tried to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
buy horses, but Chief White Wolf had the orders
spread that no horses were to be supplied to the
Americans. When some of the Pawnees went to the
American camp, to trade, Skidi and two other “dog
soldiers” or police followed them and drove them
home with whips of buffalo-hide.</p>

<p>Iskatappe only waited for other orders, to muster
the warriors and capture the camp.</p>

<p>“It can be done,” he said. “We doubtless shall
lose many men, for I think the Americans are hard
fighters. We might do better to attack them on the
march.”</p>

<p>Some of the older men were against fighting.</p>

<p>“We should not pull hot fat out of the fire with
our fingers, for the Spanish,” they said. “Let the
Spanish stop the Americans, if they can. We will
stay at home and put up the flag of the stronger
nation.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young warriors liked to gallop
near the American camp and shake their lances and
guns at it. The American warriors laughed and
shouted.</p>

<p>For the next few days Boy Scar Head was all
eyes and ears. The Americans kept close in camp
and were very watchful. Only Baroney the interpreter
rode back and forth, looking for horses.
Chief Charakterik seemed much troubled. He had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
not counted upon the Americans being so stubborn.
He sent the Kansas home. They had promised to
guide the Americans; but he gave Wah-on-son-ga a
gun and two horses, and told him that the Padoucahs
would certainly kill everybody; so Wah-on-son-ga
took his men home.</p>

<p>Frank, the Pawnee-who-had-been-to-Wash’ton,
stole the wife of an Osage and ran away with her.
This made the Osages angry; and now the Americans
were getting angry, too.</p>

<p>They had found only three or four horses.
Then—</p>

<p>“The Americans are going to march to-morrow!”</p>

<p>That was the word from the warriors who spied
upon the camp. Chief Pike rode down, unafraid,
with Baroney, to White Wolf’s lodge. Scar Head
hid in a corner, to hear what was said. He liked the
crisp voice and the handsome face of this young
Mungo-Meri Pike. Maybe he would never see him
again.</p>

<p>“Why have you told the Kansas to go home,
and made them break their promise to me?” demanded
Chief Pike, of White Wolf.</p>

<p>“The hearts of the Kansas failed them. They
decided they would only be throwing their lives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
away, to go with such a small party into the country
of the Padoucah,” answered White Wolf.</p>

<p>“You frightened them with your stories,” Chief
Pike accused. “That was not right. I have come
from your father, to make peace among his red children.
Why do you forbid your men to trade us
horses? You have plenty. Why do you not lend
us a man who speaks the Ietan tongue, to help us?”</p>

<p>“If, as you say, we all are children of the American
father, then we do not wish our brothers to give
up their lives,” White Wolf said. “But we do not
know. The Spanish claim this country, too. They
are coming back next spring. We promised them
not to let you march through. You can come next
spring and talk with them.”</p>

<p>“No!” thundered Chief Pike. “We are going
to march on. We are Americans and will go where
we are ordered by the great father. The Osages
have given us five of their horses. They have shown
a good heart. I will speak well of them, to their
father.”</p>

<p>“They gave you their poor horses, because they
got better ones from us,” replied White Wolf.</p>

<p>“If the Pawnee try to stop us, it will cost them
at least one hundred warriors,” Chief Pike asserted.
“You will have to kill every one of us, and we will
die fighting. Then the American nation will send<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
such an army that the very name Pawnee will be
forgotten.” He arose, and his flashing blue eyes
marked Boy Scar Head huddled upon a roll of
buffalo-robes. “Who is that boy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“He is my son,” Charakterik answered.</p>

<p>“He cannot be your son,” reproved Chief Pike.
“He is white, you are red. I think he is an American.
Where did you get him?”</p>

<p>“He is my son. I have adopted him,” White
Wolf insisted. “I got him from the Utahs.”</p>

<p>“Where are his parents?”</p>

<p>“I am his parent. I do not know anything
more.”</p>

<p>“You must give him up. He is not an Indian,”
said Chief Pike.</p>

<p>“He is a Pawnee. Why should I give him up?”
argued Charakterik.</p>

<p>“Because the great father wishes all captives to
be given up. The Potawatomi had many captives
from the Osage. They have been given up. There
cannot be good feeling between people when they
hold captives from each other. I ask you to send this
boy down river. Two French traders are in your
town now. You can send the boy with them.”</p>

<p>“I will think upon what you say,” White Wolf
replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>So Chief Pike left.</p>

<p>“Why did you come in here to listen?” scolded
White Wolf, of Scar Head. “You are making me
trouble. Do you want to be sent away with those
traders?”</p>

<p>“No,” Scar Head admitted. For the two French
traders were dark, dirty little men, not at all like the
Americans. He preferred the Pawnees to those
traders. But if he were an American, himself——?
An American the same as the Pike Americans! That
sounded good.</p>

<p>He could see that White Wolf was troubled; and
the rest of the day he kept out of sight. Early in
the morning the two French traders went away, but
he had not been sent for. Chief Charakterik probably
had matters of more importance to think about.</p>

<p>The Americans were breaking camp. The Pawnee
young men, urged by Iskatappe and Skidi, were
painting for battle, while the women filled the quivers
and sharpened the lance points, and cleaned the guns
afresh.</p>

<p>The sun mounted higher. A close watch was
kept upon the American camp, plain in view up the
Republican River. Shortly after noon the cry
welled:</p>

<p>“They are coming! Shall we let them pass?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“No! Kill them!”</p>

<p>“See where they are going, first.”</p>

<p>“Wait till they are in the village.”</p>

<p>Nobody knew exactly what to do. The Americans
were marching down, their horses together,
their ranks formed, their guns ready; and they
looked small beside the four hundred and more
warriors of the Pawnees. It was a brave act.</p>

<p>“They are not striking the village. They are
going around,” Rich Man shouted. “We shall have
to fight them in the open. That is bad.”</p>

<p>The young warriors like Skidi ran to and fro,
handling their bows and lances and guns. They
waited for orders from White Wolf; but White
Wolf only stood at the door of his lodge, with his
arms folded, and said nothing as he watched the
American column.</p>

<p>Mungo-Meri Pike was smart. He acted like a
war chief. He was marching around, far enough
out so that if he were attacked the Pawnees could
not hide behind their mud houses. Now to charge
on those well-armed Americans, in the open, would
cost many lives; and no Pawnee wished to be the
first to fall.</p>

<p>The Americans had come opposite, and no gun
had yet been fired, when on a sudden Chief Pike left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
them. With Baroney and one soldier he galloped
across, for the village. That was a bold deed, but he
did not seem to fear. He paid no attention to the
warriors who scowled at him. He made way
through them straight to Chief Charakterik. He
spoke loudly, so that all about might hear.</p>

<p>“I have come to say good-by. I hope that when
we come again we will find the great father’s flag
still flying.”</p>

<p>“You had better go quickly,” White Wolf replied.
“The Spanish will be angry with us, and
my young men are hard to hold.”</p>

<p>“We are going,” Chief Pike assured. “We are
going, as we said we would. If your young men
mean to stop us, let them try. Two of our horses
were stolen from us this morning. They were Pawnee
horses. One was returned to us by your men.
The other is missing. I am sure that the Pawnee
do not sell us horses at a high price, so as to steal
them. That is not honest. If you are a chief you
will get the horse back for us, or the Pawnee will
have a bad name for crooked tongues. So I will
leave one of my men, who will receive the horse
and bring it on. He will wait till the sun is overhead,
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I will see what I can do,” White Wolf answered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
“The horse may have only strayed. A
present might find him again.”</p>

<p>“The horse is ours,” reproved Chief Pike. “I
shall not buy it twice. If the Pawnees are honest
and wish to be friends with their American brothers,
they will return the horse to me. I shall expect it,
to-morrow. Adios.”</p>

<p>“Adios,” grunted White Wolf, wrapping his
robe about him.</p>

<p>Chief Pike and Baroney the interpreter galloped
for the column. They left the soldier. Now he
was one American among all the Pawnees, but he
did not act afraid, either.</p>

<p>He sat his horse and gazed about him with a
smile. He was a stout, chunky man, in stained blue
clothes. His face was partly covered with red hair,
and the hair on his head, under his slouched black
hat, was red, too. He carried a long-barreled heavy
gun in the hollow of one arm.</p>

<p>“Get down,” signed White Wolf. “Come into
my lodge.” And he waved the crowding warriors
back.</p>

<p>The red-haired soldier got down and entered the
lodge. Here he was safe. Everything of his was
safe as long as he was a guest of a lodge. Scar
Head slipped in after him, but White Wolf stayed
outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“The American chief has lost a horse,” he announced.
“The horse must be brought back, or we
shall have a bad name with our American father.”</p>

<p>“If the American chief has lost a horse, let him
promise a present and maybe it will be found,”
answered Skidi.</p>

<p>“That is no way to talk,” Charakterik rebuked.
“I want the horse brought to me; then we will see
about the present.”</p>

<p>“The present is here already,” laughed Skidi.
“It is in your lodge. The American chief would
have done better to lose all his horses and say nothing,
for a red scalp is big medicine.”</p>

<p>And all the warriors laughed.</p>

<p>Inside the lodge the American soldier grinned at
Scar Head. Scar Head grinned back.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said the soldier.</p>

<p>Scar Head had heard that word several times.
Now he blurted it, himself.</p>

<p>“H’lo.”</p>

<p>This was the end of the conversation, but Scar
Head did a lot of thinking. He well knew where
the horse was. Skidi had stolen it and hidden it out,
and boasted of his feat. Now Skidi was talking of
keeping the red-hair. That did not seem right. The
Americans were brave. If somebody—a boy—should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
go out and bring the horse in, then Skidi
might not dare to claim it, and White Wolf would
send it and the red-hair on to Pike, and there would
be no more trouble. Yes, being an American, himself
(as they had said), Scar Head decided that he
ought to help the other Americans.</p>

<p>He would get the horse.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br />
<small>ON THE TRAIL OF THE SPANIARDS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Early in the morning, before yet even the
squaws were stirring, Scar Head slipped out to get
the horse. He found it picketed near the river, just
where Skidi had cleverly concealed it. He led it in
and tied it short, before the lodge door. Then he
crept back to bed again. It would be safe, for nobody
would dare remove it from the limits of the
chiefs lodge.</p>

<p>The squaws were up first, of course, to start
the fires and prepare the breakfasts. Charakterik’s
two wives, an old one and a young one, arose and
went outside. Lying quiet Scar Head heard them
talking.</p>

<p>“Someone has brought a horse,” said the young
squaw. “It is a Pawnee horse.”</p>

<p>“That is queer,” said the old squaw. “Who
is making White Wolf such a present? This must
be the horse that was stolen from the Americans.
The thief has changed his heart, and grown afraid.”</p>

<p>“Or else it is a marriage gift,” giggled the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
young squaw. “Someone is looking for a wife
in our lodge.”</p>

<p>“Who is there, to be married?” the old squaw
demanded.</p>

<p>“We are the only women, so it must be that
someone is in love with me,” the young squaw
giggled again.</p>

<p>“You!” scoffed the old squaw. “Who would
look at you? You are not worth a horse. No; the
horse offering is made for me.”</p>

<p>And they both laughed. They knew better than
to rouse Charakterik and tell him. Their business
was to get the breakfast, and let him discover the
horse, himself.</p>

<p>White Wolf and the American soldier were still
snoozing upon their buffalo-robe couches. Pretty
soon Scar Head could wait no longer. He went
outside, yawning and rubbing his eyes, and pretended
to be surprised by the horse.</p>

<p>“Whose horse is that?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Ask it, and maybe you will know more than
we do.”</p>

<p>“Who brought it?”</p>

<p>“That is none of our affair; nor of yours, either.
It was here when we came out.”</p>

<p>“It had not been here very long,” added the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
young squaw, to the elder. “See? The ground is
only little trampled.”</p>

<p>“If you want to know where it came from,”
continued the old squaw, to Scar Head, “you should
trail it back, instead of asking silly questions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and get into trouble. A gift is a gift, and
not to be doubted,” the young squaw added.</p>

<p>At this, Scar Head ran off, to the river, for his
morning swim. When he returned, Chief Charakterik
and the American soldier were up and out,
too, and surveying the horse.</p>

<p>“Do you know where this horse came from?”
White Wolf questioned, of his wives.</p>

<p>“No. It was here. That is all.”</p>

<p>“The man who stole the horse from the Americans
has returned it,” declared White Wolf. “Good.
Is this the horse you are waiting for?” he asked,
of the soldier.</p>

<p>The soldier did not understand the words, but
he understood the gesture. Now he smiled and
replied in his own language—which nobody else
understood. But he nodded and pointed to the
horse and in the direction of the Americans; and
they all understood that.</p>

<p>“After you have eaten, you may take the horse
and go your way,” White Wolf bade, well satisfied.</p>

<p>So the matter seemed to be settled; but somehow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
Scar Head did not feel quite happy. The
matter was settled too easily. In a few minutes
the soldier would go; then all the Americans would
be gone, and he himself would have lost them. In
fact, he didn’t seem to be getting much out of his
scheme, except that he may have saved the soldier’s
scalp. Skidi would be angry, too, when he found
out that the horse and soldier both had gone. Somebody
would suffer—and Scar Head rather foresaw
who that somebody might be! Skidi could make
things very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>But before they were done eating, here came
Skidi and several others, of the men, all furious.</p>

<p>“There is the horse,” exclaimed Skidi. “And
there is the red-haired white man. We are in time.”</p>

<p>“What is all this shouting about?” reproved
White Wolf. “This is no way to come to a chief’s
lodge.”</p>

<p>“We come for a horse that has been stolen by
that white man,” Skidi boldly retorted. “There
it is. We claim it.”</p>

<p>“No. The horse belongs to the American chief.
His soldier is here to get it. We talked about that
yesterday. I will talk no more.”</p>

<p>“I will talk, for I am a man,” answered Skidi.
“You let the white man eat at your fire and sleep
in your lodge, and during the night he steals a horse.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
Are you a chief, that you close your eyes to such
things? We ask for our horse, or else a large
present.”</p>

<p>“Whose horse is it?”</p>

<p>“It is a Pawnee horse, and that is enough.”</p>

<p>“The horse was not here last night, but it was
here early this morning,” announced White Wolf.
“The American did not go out and get it. I am
sure of that. If he did, why should he have brought
it here, if he had stolen it? He could have easily
made off with it, and others. No; the thief who
took the horse from the Americans has returned it,
as is right. Let the man who claims to own the
horse come forward. But I think there is nothing
more to be said.”</p>

<p>The soldier was sitting, in his stained blue clothes,
and gazing around with a good-natured smile on his
hairy face; but Scar Head could see that he was
thinking fast, and ready to spring for the lodge
and his gun.</p>

<p>“Are you going to send him away with the
horse?”</p>

<p>“Who owns the horse?” White Wolf replied.
“Why was it left at my lodge door if not for the
American to take with him? Somebody had bad
dreams, and went and got the horse, so that he
might sleep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>“In that case, the man deserves a present,”
Skidi declared. “Let a present be given in exchange
for the horse and the American may go.”</p>

<p>“To whom shall the present be given?” White
Wolf inquired.</p>

<p>“I will take the present, and give it to the man
who owns the horse,” said Skidi. “But of course if
he has done this good deed he may wish to be
secret about it, and if he is accused of having done
an evil deed in the first place, he does not wish to
be pointed at as a thief.”</p>

<p>“The American chief sent no present. He only
asked for a horse that had been taken from him.
Here it is, left on the prairie at my door, and I give
it back to him.”</p>

<p>With that, Chief Charakterik stood and folded
his robe around him, as sign that he was done. The
soldier rose, also.</p>

<p>But the squad led by Skidi murmured angrily.
Somebody reached to grasp the horse’s neck rope—</p>

<p>“No. Let him take it. He will not go far.”</p>

<p>“There will be a red scalp, for a dance, to-night.”</p>

<p>“The Americans will think the Pawnee are
cowards, if all they need do is ask for a horse
and get it.”</p>

<p>“You talk like children,” White Wolf reproved.
“Who among you claims the horse? Nobody. Why<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
was it left at my door, if not for me? Or did it come
of itself? It is mine and I can do with it as I
please.”</p>

<p>“But the present! You will shame all the town
if you, a great chief, yield this way to the Americans.
There is no proof that they have lost a horse, and
why should you give one up to them, for nothing?
You have no right to give the horse away until you
find out why it was left at your lodge. You should
wait and find out. People do not leave horses at
lodges without expecting something in return. I
may have left the horse, myself; and I might look
for a present. Where is the present?”</p>

<p>Thus Skidi cunningly argued.</p>

<p>“Yes, where is the present?” they all demanded.
“You need not make it, yourself. You can ask it
from the Americans. Or tell the soldier to go; and
if he doesn’t like to go alone, we will help him on
his way.”</p>

<p>Scar Head suddenly spoke up.</p>

<p>“The American can have the horse, White Wolf.
I brought it, and I want no present.”</p>

<p>Everybody gaped. White Wolf turned on him
severely.</p>

<p>“You? You are a boy. Why do you say the
American can have the horse? If you brought it,
where did you get it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>“I found it.”</p>

<p>“Whose horse is it?”</p>

<p>“It belongs to the American chief. It is the
one he lost.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Scar Head. “It was hidden,
but I went and got it.”</p>

<p>“You lie! You are a meddler!” Skidi stormed,
furious. “Wait till I lay my hands on you.”</p>

<p>“I do not lie. I brought the horse, and I can
show where I found it,” Scar Head answered.</p>

<p>“That is boy’s talk,” appealed Skidi. “Look at
him! He is no Pawnee, as everybody knows. He
is not even an Indian. Who can believe what he
says? Are warriors to be ruled by a boy? I demand
a council, on this horse—and I will attend to
that piece of impudence when I catch him away
from the lodge.”</p>

<p>Chief Charakterik hesitated. Attracted by the
loud voice of Skidi the village was gathering; Iskatappe
had come, and Old Knife, and other leading
men who were unfriendly to the Americans; and
Scar Head felt small. Now Skidi had called for a
council; and between the council and Skidi the red-haired
soldier and he himself were likely to fare
rather badly. Charakterik, too, looked angry. Only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
the soldier stood smiling, backed against the lodge
doorway, his gun in his hands.</p>

<p>But right in the midst of the crisis, somebody else
arrived. It was Baroney, the interpreter for Chief
Pike.</p>

<p>“Go into the lodge,” ordered White Wolf, to
Scar Head. “You have made bad work. I will
talk with you later.”</p>

<p>Scar Head went in, disgraced. Outside, the
voices continued, with White Wolf, and Skidi, and
Baroney doing most of the speaking, and Rich Man
and Letalesha adding remarks.</p>

<p>After a short time they all quit. White Wolf
entered, with Baroney and the soldier.</p>

<p>“You are going away,” he said. “You may get
your yellow pony and make ready.”</p>

<p>“Where am I going?”</p>

<p>“With these two men, to the American camp.
The horse matter is settled. The American chief
has sent a present, for the horse. Everybody is satisfied.
But you did a wrong thing, when you interfered
in men’s affairs. Why did you do that?”</p>

<p>“I like the Americans,” Scar Head stammered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied White Wolf. “What Skidi said
is true. You are not red, you are white, and they all
know it. You can never be an Indian. Now you
have lost friends. The Pawnee will always look at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
you sideways, and Skidi is likely to harm you. So
I give you to the American chief, to be rid of you
before you are hurt. He asked me to send you away.
If I keep you it may mean trouble for me also. Get
your horse. These two men are waiting.”</p>

<p>His brain in a whirl, Scar Head hastened out,
for his yellow pony. As he passed through the village,
there were scowls and jeers, because now nobody
respected him as the chief’s son; but he did not
care. He was an American, and these Pawnees
were no longer his people. So he tried to walk fast,
like an American, and pay no attention to the black
looks and the slurs.</p>

<p>He rode back, on his pony. The two men were
waiting, on their horses, with the other horse in tow.
White Wolf’s lodge received him kindly. His
brother, White Wolf’s real son, handed him a horn
bow and otter-skin quiver of arrows.</p>

<p>“They are for you. Do not forget your
brother.”</p>

<p>The old squaw put new beaded moccasins upon
his feet.</p>

<p>“They are for you. Do not forget your
mother.”</p>

<p>The young squaw clasped a silver bracelet upon
his wrist.</p>

<p>“It is for you. Do not forget your sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>White Wolf threw a white-tanned robe, soft and
warm, from a young buffalo-cow, over his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Do not forget your father. You did wrong,
but your heart was good. Remember that you have
been a chief’s son. Always bear yourself like a
warrior. To a warrior, heat and cold and thirst
and hunger are nothing. A brave man lives, while
a coward dies. Now go.”</p>

<p>“Come,” said Baroney. The stocky soldier
smiled brightly.</p>

<p>With never a backward glance they galloped out
of the town, into the south and on.</p>

<p>Baroney began to lead. With the horse in tow,
the soldier slackened, to ride alongside Scar Head.
He grinned, and spoke.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said, again.</p>

<p>“H’lo,” responded Scar Head.</p>

<p>The soldier rubbed his nose, as if figuring upon
what to say next.</p>

<p>“American, you?” he queried.</p>

<p>Scar Head caught the word, and nodded. The
soldier spoke farther, with another question.</p>

<p>“He asks your name,” called back Baroney. “I
will tell him. His name is Sparks. He is a good
man. They are all good men. You will be happy
with the Americans.”</p>

<p>“Sparks!” That was a simple name and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
good one, because it fitted. Fire might be his medicine;
the stiff bright hairs of his face were the red
sparks, shooting out.</p>

<p>The American chief had camped at only a short
distance from the Pawnee town, waiting on peace or
war. There were shouts of welcome, for Baroney
and Sparks, and many curious gazes for Scar Head.
He rode proudly, on his yellow pony, with his warrior’s
bow and arrows, his chief-beaded moccasins,
his bracelet and his white cow-robe. He was no
longer afraid of the Americans. Baroney took him
on to Chief Pike, who was standing beside his
saddled horse.</p>

<p>The camp lodges had been struck, the Americans
were ready to march.</p>

<p>Baroney explained to the young chief. Chief
Pike listened—he nodded, and spoke, and with a
smile reached to shake Scar Head’s hand. The
medicine man also spoke, and smiled, and shook
hands. The young second chief came and did the
same. Then they got on their horses.</p>

<p>“It is well,” said Baroney to Scar Head. “You
will ride in front, with the chiefs.”</p>

<p>“Where do we go?”</p>

<p>“We go to the mountains, and to find the Ietans.”</p>

<p>Scar Head said nothing, to that. It was a long
way, and the danger way, but he was with braves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
who seemed to feel no fears. They appeared to
know what they were about.</p>

<p>Chief Pike shouted a command and led out. The
second chief repeated the command, and turned in
his saddle to see that it was obeyed; then he galloped
to the fore. The two chiefs rode first, side
by side. Baroney signed, and Scar Head found
himself between Baroney and the medicine-man.
Four Osages, still—Chief Pretty Bird, two warriors
and a woman—followed. The American warriors
trudged after, two by two, in a column, with the
extra horses bearing packs.</p>

<p>The warriors numbered eighteen. It was a small
party, for a great nation, when one remembered that
the Spanish had sent several hundred and that the
Padoucahs or Ietans (the Comanches) numbered
thousands. The Osages of course need not be
counted. The Pawnees thought little of Osages—a
poor and miserable people.</p>

<p>The Spanish had left a very broad, plain trail.
The Americans were following it, although it was an
old trail and the Spanish chief had been gone several
weeks. It stretched straight southward, toward the
Kansas country, and the Padoucah and the Spanish
country, beyond. If the young chief Pike followed
far enough, in that direction, he would have need
of all his medicine to get out again. But perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
he would turn west, in time, and aim for the unknown
mountains, many days’ journey—although what he
expected to find there, nobody might say.</p>

<p>It was the home of the Utahs, who warred upon
plains people and were friendly to only the Spanish.</p>

<p>He was a bold man, this young Chief Pike.</p>

<p>The march southward continued all day, pursuing
the trail, until when the sun was getting low
and the shadows long a place was reached where the
Spanish had camped.</p>

<p>Chief Pike examined the signs. The Spanish of
Chief Melgares had camped in a circle. There were
fifty-nine burnt spots, from campfires. Allowing six
warriors to each fire, that counted up over three
hundred and fifty. The grasses had been eaten off
by the horses.</p>

<p>Chief Pike led his eighteen warriors on a little
distance, and ordered camp for the night beside a
fork of the river of the Kansas. Scar Head was
well treated; the American medicine man or “doctor”
eyed him a great deal, but did him no harm;
the warrior Sparks grinned at him, and beckoned
to him, but he did not go. It was a cheerful camp,
with the men singing and joking in their strange
language.</p>

<p>He ate at the fire of the two chiefs and the medicine-man.
They and Baroney the interpreter talked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
together. Soon after dark everybody went to bed,
except the guards, and except Chief Pike, who sat
up, in his lodge, making black marks on white leaves,
by the fire of a sputtering white stick!</p>

<p>Scar Head rolled in his buffalo robe, at one side
of the lodge; the couch for the medicine-man (who
was already on it) and for the chief, was at the
other side. He stayed awake as long as he could,
watching lest the medicine-man should try to feel
of the spot on his head, again; but he was tired, and
before the chief had finished making marks, he fell
asleep.</p>

<small>THE CHASE OF THE BIG ELK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Bang!</p>

<p>One of the American guards, stationed on a little
rise, had fired his gun, as an alarm signal.</p>

<p>It was noon, of the second day, and Chief Pike
had halted his men to eat, and graze the horses. At
the signal, everybody looked.</p>

<p>“Injuns!” cried the Americans, while the guard
pointed and called.</p>

<p>Scar Head likewise looked.</p>

<p>“Pawnee,” he said. He knew them instantly,
although they were still far off.</p>

<p>Chief Pike and the young sub-chief shouted
orders. The soldiers seized their guns and formed
to protect the horses; the guards came running in.
Scar Head strung his bow and plucked a good arrow
from his quiver. The “doctor” or medicine-man,
standing with gun in hand, smiled and asked him a
question, in French.</p>

<p>“What are you doing? Making ready to fight?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Good,” praised the medicine-man. “You will
fight for the Americans?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“I am American,” asserted Scar Head. “American.
No Pawnee.”</p>

<p>The medicine-man laughed, but he seemed
pleased.</p>

<p>There were many of the Pawnees—fully three
hundred. They approached swiftly, across the rolling
prairie, from the north. They were horseback,
but they acted like a war party—all were warriors,
with guns and bows and lances. What did they
want? Even Scar Head could not guess. Had
Charakterik decided to let the Americans be attacked?
That was foolish. The Americans were ready, and
would fight hard.</p>

<p>Or, perhaps Iskatappe and Skidi and other hot-hearts
had planned this without permission, and
were determined to see what they might do.</p>

<p>The Americans stood in a half circle, facing
the Pawnees, their horses tied short, behind them.
Chief Pike stood in front of the center, his sword
in his hand. His sub-chief was at one end and
the medicine-man at the other end. Scar Head fitted
his arrow upon his bow, twitched his quiver around
so that he might reach it more easily, and ran closer
to the medicine-man’s end, where he could shoot
better. The soldier Sparks was here, too.</p>

<p>Iskatappe led the Pawnees. They were nearing
fast. Yes, Skidi was among them. Scar Head decided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
to loose his arrows upon Skidi, who had called
him a liar and who was the mischief-maker. Now
Chief Pike uttered a sharp command, and the gun-locks
of the few Americans all clicked; he uttered
another command, and the guns of the few Americans
all rose to a level line. Scar Head lifted his
bow and bent it, pointing his arrow upward, his eyes
measuring the distance to Skidi.</p>

<p>But on a sudden the Pawnees stopped short, so
that their ponies’ forehoofs ploughed the sod, and
Iskatappe and another chief rode forward more
slowly, with the peace sign.</p>

<p>Chief Pike barked a command, so that the Americans’
guns were lowered. Baroney went out and
joined him, and they two met Iskatappe and the
other chief.</p>

<p>After all, Iskatappe only gave Chief Pike a piece
of meat. They rode in together, and the Pawnees
came on, and the Americans let them.</p>

<p>“No war,” smiled the medicine-man, over his
shoulder, at Scar Head.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” grunted Scar Head, but he was suspicious.
When the Pawnees acted this way, they
were of two minds. The Americans would do well
to watch out. They did watch, but it was hard to
keep so many Pawnees at a distance. They edged
about, smiling and alert for chances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>“Hello, little sneak,” greeted Skidi, of Scar
Head.</p>

<p>“Hello, thief,” Scar Head boldly answered.
“You are the sneak. You give with one hand and
take back with the other.”</p>

<p>“You talk big,” sneered Skidi. “Once you were
a chief’s son; now you are nothing. When I catch
you, some day, you will be less than nothing.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you catch me now?” Scar Head
retorted. “I am with the Americans. I am not
afraid of you.”</p>

<p>“You are not worth the trouble. We are hunting
meat. The Padoucah can have you and those
Osages. They and the Spanish will eat you all, for
us, and save us the bother. If we did not believe
that, we would never have let the Americans come
even this far.”</p>

<p>It appeared to be true that the Pawnees were
hunting, and not bent upon war. Iskatappe had
brought Chief Pike a present of bear meat, to wipe
out the memory of the horse-theft, he said. But the
Americans stood ready, trying to see what the Pawnees
really were up to—and Scar Head kept his eye
upon the crafty Skidi.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Chief Pike and Iskatappe shook
hands again. The Pawnees were to ride one way,
the Americans another. Scar Head was just in time.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
As the Americans started, he brushed against the
medicine-man, so as to warn, with his French words:</p>

<p>“Knife. No knife.”</p>

<p>The medicine-man instantly felt of the knife
scabbard on his saddle. It was empty, as Scar Head
well knew, for he had seen the clever Skidi steal
the knife out. Now the “doctor” exclaimed, and
spoke quickly to Chief Pike. They both reined aside,
so did Baroney the interpreter—</p>

<p>“Come,” beckoned the medicine-man, to Scar
Head; and while the column went on with the second
chief, they turned back to the Pawnees.</p>

<p>“We have come for a knife that is lost,” announced
Chief Pike, to Iskatappe, with Baroney talking
for him in bad Pawnee.</p>

<p>“We know nothing about any knife,” asserted
Rich Man, stiffly.</p>

<p>“A knife is missing from this man’s saddle,”
Chief Pike insisted. “I ask you to get it for me.”</p>

<p>“You grow angry about a very small thing,”
Iskatappe replied. “What is one knife to you?
Besides, you say it is lost. Very well; then you
should find it. We know nothing about it.”</p>

<p>Chief Pike flushed, angry indeed. His blue eyes
looked hot.</p>

<p>“Whether or not it is a small thing, we Americans
are not men who can be robbed. The knife may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
seem of little value, but it is ours. I am here to get
it from you.”</p>

<p>“That is strong talk,” Iskatappe answered. “I
have no knife of yours. Where is your knife?”</p>

<p>“Who has it?” the medicine-man asked, in quick
low voice, of Scar Head.</p>

<p>“Skidi,” whispered Scar Head.</p>

<p>The medicine-man pushed forward to Baroney,
and spoke with him.</p>

<p>“This man says your warrior named Skidi has
his knife,” said Baroney, to Iskatappe.</p>

<p>“We will see,” replied Iskatappe. He called
Skidi, and told him to throw back his robe; and
sure enough, there was the knife.</p>

<p>“I did not know that it was that man’s knife,”
Skidi defended. “I found it on the trail. Now it is
mine. If I give it up, I must have another to take
its place.”</p>

<p>“Your warrior lies,” Chief Pike flatly retorted,
to Iskatappe. “He stole the knife. Otherwise, how
did we know that he had it?”</p>

<p>Matters looked bad. The Pawnees were surrounding
thicker and thicker, and the other Americans
had gone on. But Chief Pike gave no sign
that he was afraid; neither did the medicine-man.
Only Baroney acted uneasy, and Scar Head’s heart
beat rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>“What the American chief says, sounds true,”
remarked Iskatappe, while Skidi glared and his
friends jostled and murmured. “But maybe Skidi
is right, too. He should have another knife.”</p>

<p>“We are not here to trade knives. When an
honest man finds what belongs to another, he returns
it,” Chief Pike replied.</p>

<p>“Much time is being wasted over a matter of no
account,” growled Iskatappe. “Here is your knife,”
and he plucked it from Skidi’s waist. “I am not
stingy, so I give him one to take its place.” And
so he did.</p>

<p>Chief Pike passed the knife to the medicine-man.
The medicine-man was wise. He immediately passed
it back to Iskatappe.</p>

<p>“It is now yours. Keep it. By this you see that
we did not come for the knife; we came for justice.”</p>

<p>“You show us that your hearts are good, after
all,” Rich Man granted. “I think you have done
well.”</p>

<p>The faces of the Pawnees cleared, even Skidi
seemed satisfied, and after shaking hands once more
Chief Pike led out for the column and left the Pawnees
to go their way also.</p>

<p>The Americans under the second chief were a
long way ahead. Chief Pike acted as if in no hurry.
He and the medicine-man cantered easily and chatted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
and laughed like brothers; Scar Head and Baroney
cantered together, behind them.</p>

<p>“Our scalps were loose, back there,” uttered
Baroney.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Scar Head. “I smelled blood.”</p>

<p>“You are no Pawnee. They would scalp you,
too. Were you afraid?”</p>

<p>“No. No one is afraid, with Chief Pike.”</p>

<p>Baroney laughed. He was a small, dark, black-bearded
man who spoke about as much Pawnee as
Scar Head spoke French, but was good at the sign
language; so by using all three means, with now and
then a word of Spanish, he got along.</p>

<p>They had ridden about a mile, and were slowly
overtaking the American column, when another band
of figures came charging. The medicine-man sighted
them, the first, for he pointed—and they indeed
looked, at a distance, to be more Indians, issuing
from ambush in a river bottom on the left and
launching themselves to cut off the Chief Pike squad.</p>

<p>Scar Head himself read them with one keen stare.</p>

<p>“Elk,” he grunted, in Pawnee, and stiffened
with the hunt feeling.</p>

<p>Baroney called, excitedly; but Chief Pike had
read, too. He shouted, turned his horse and shook
his reins and flourished his gun, and away he dashed,
to meet the elk. In a flash Scar Head clapped his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
heels against his pony’s ribs, and tore after. The
medicine-man and Baroney tore, too, on a course
of their own.</p>

<p>The yellow pony was a fast pony, well trained.
He had been stolen from the Comanches, whose
horses were the best. Scar Head rode light—a boy
in only a buffalo robe. The American horses all
were poor horses, even those traded for with the
Pawnees, and Chief Pike, in his clothes, weighed
twice as much, on the saddle, as Scar Head.</p>

<p>The yellow pony over-hauled the Chief Pike
horse—crept up, from tail to stirrup, from stirrup
to neck, from neck to nose. Scar Head, his moccasined
feet thrust into thong loops, clung close.
Chief Pike glanced aside at him, with blue eyes glowing,
and smiled.</p>

<p>“Good meat,” he said, in French. “We two
hunt.”</p>

<p>“Kill,” answered Scar Head.</p>

<p>“Can you kill?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What with?”</p>

<p>“This.” And Scar Head shook his strung bow.</p>

<p>Chief Pike laughed.</p>

<p>“They are large; you are small. With a gun—yes.
With a bow—I think not.”</p>

<p>“You will see,” Scar Head promised. His heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
was filled with the desire to prove himself to Chief
Pike. But he had never killed an elk—nothing
larger than a badger; he only knew that it might
be done.</p>

<p>They raced. The elk were foolish things, and
appeared to be thinking more of some danger behind
than the danger before. No—now Baroney and
the medicine-man had frightened them afresh, for
they had swerved, they paralleled the trail, and were
scouring on to gain the open.</p>

<p>Good riding might head them.</p>

<p>The yellow pony knew. He ran like a deer, himself.
Chief Pike’s horse lengthened bravely.</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi!” Scar Head urged.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cheered the chief.</p>

<p>They were veering in. The band of elk were led
by a splendid buck, whose horns branched like a tree.
The elk chief ran with his nose out and his horns
laid upon his neck, but now and again he shook his
head, and his horns tossed.</p>

<p>Baroney and the medicine-man were trying to
close in, on the rear flank—the medicine-man had
shot. Scar Head belabored his pony harder. The
wind whistled in his ears, his white robe had dropped
about his thighs, he rode with his legs and notched
an arrow upon his bow-string. His eyes were upon
the elk chief, and he almost lost sight of Chief Pike,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
although he knew that Pike was thudding close
beside him.</p>

<p>The reports of the medicine-man and Baroney
guns sounded, driving the elk before them. The elk
chief saw the two enemies cutting him off before.
He recoiled sharply, to turn, but the herd forced
him on; they all bunched, confused. This was the
chance, and in charged Scar Head, on his yellow
pony.</p>

<p>“Le grand cerf (The large stag)!” Chief Pike
gasped.</p>

<p>“Oui (yes)!” answered Scar Head.</p>

<p>The herd broke. On bolted the stag, tossing his
great horns. After him pelted Scar Head and Chief
Pike. It was another chase. But, see! The Pawnees
were coming, from before. The chase was
leading straight for them, they had seen, and fifty
or sixty of their best hunters had galloped in a long
line, for a surround.</p>

<p>The stag saw, too. Or else he smelled. He
turned at right angles, to escape the net. A minute
or two more, and the yellow pony was at his straining
haunches, and Scar Head was leaning forward
with bow bent to the arrow’s head.</p>

<p>“Look out! Look out!” Chief Pike shouted.</p>

<p>With a mighty leap the stag sprang aside,
whirled, and charged the yellow pony. His bristling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
horns were down, his eyes shone greenly. Around
whirled the yellow pony, also, and scrambled for
safety. Scar Head, clinging and urging, gazed backward
and laughed to show that he was not afraid.
Chief Pike, his pistol held high, pursued, to the
rescue.</p>

<p>But the elk chief changed heart. The yellow
pony nimbly dodged, and he went on. Scar Head
closed in on him once more. Chief Pike was coming;
the arrow should be sped now or never.</p>

<p>The elk chief was spattered with froth from
shoulder to haunch; his great horns, polished at the
tips but still ragged with their velvet, lay flat, reaching
to his back. Scar Head forged on farther and
farther, his bow arched from arrow notch to arrow
point; he leaned, aimed quickly, and loosed. It was
a warrior’s bow, and the recoil jarred his whole
arm, but the arrow had sunk to its feathers in the
right spot, just behind the elk’s fore shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hi!” cheered Scar Head. He whipped another
arrow from his quiver; without slackening
speed he fitted it to the bow.</p>

<p>The elk chief had given a tremendous bound;
for a moment it seemed as though he would get
away yet. On thudded the yellow pony, in the rear
at the other side on thudded Chief Pike, ready to
use his pistol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>Before, the Pawnees were yelling. Scar Head
feared that he was going to lose his kill to them,
or to Chief Pike. That would never do. He kicked
his pony fiercely. Ha! The old chief was failing,
as the arrow point worked. The pony drew up on
him. Now another arrow. <a href="#i_097">Whang! It buried itself
almost out of sight behind the elk chief’s ribs.</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_097">
  <img src="images/i_097.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_97">WHANG! IT BURIED ITSELF ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT BEHIND THE ELK
CHIEF’S RIBS</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The elk chief bounded high, screamed, turned
blindly, and with one more bound crashed headlong
to the ground. The yellow pony leaped right across
him as he struggled to rise. But he rose only half
way, still screaming with rage. Then, just as Chief
Pike arrived, and Scar Head, twisting the yellow
pony, leveled a third arrow, he collapsed, gushing
blood from his mouth, and quivered and died.</p>

<p>Scar Head yelled the scalp halloo. He had killed
the elk chief, a mighty animal indeed.</p>

<p>Chief Pike, out of breath, swung his hat and
cheered, too. He got off his horse, and walked
around the elk, examining it. He examined the
arrow wounds, with the reddened feather tips just
showing.</p>

<p>“That was well done,” he said.</p>

<p>Scar Head sat happy, breathing fast. The scar
under his white mark throbbed and burned, as it
always did when he worked hard or played hard, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
he was happy. His heart glowed at the praise by
Chief Pike. He felt like a man.</p>

<p>“Yours,” he panted. “I kill. You keep.”</p>

<p>“It is much meat,” replied Chief Pike.</p>

<p>Baroney and the medicine-man were chasing
hither-thither. The Pawnees were killing. Chief
Pike galloped away to see. But he would see no
arrows buried deeper than these.</p>

<p>After the hunt was over, the Pawnees cut up
their animals, and the Pike party cut up the big elk.
With Scar Head riding proudly, they four caught
the column under the second chief. The camp
feasted, this night, upon a spot where the Spanish
also had camped. There was only one alarm call,
from the guard, on account of two Pawnees who
came in by mistake. They had not eaten for three
days and thought that this was a camp of their own
people.</p>

<p>Chief Pike sent them out again, with food for
a sick comrade. He was kind as well as brave.</p>

<small>LIEUTENANT WILKINSON SAYS GOOD-BY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Chief Pike asks you to go back with one man
and find John Sparks.”</p>

<p>These were the words of Baroney, to Scar Head,
who was just finishing breakfast so as to be ready
to march.</p>

<p>A number of days had passed since the elk hunt,
and several things had happened. Although the
Americans were brave, the Great Spirit seemed to
be angry with them for marching through the country.
He gave them hungry camps, without wood
and water. He sent rain on them, and made them
sick. Chief Pretty Bird and another Osage man
had left. They said that they wanted better hunting—but
it was plain that they were afraid. And on
the same day the Spanish trail had been blotted out
by buffalo hoofs, and the Americans had lost it.</p>

<p>By the talk, this was bad. According to what
Scar Head understood, Chief Pike depended upon
the Spanish trail to guide him by the best road
into the south and to the Comanches. The Spanish
knew this country better than the Americans did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>The rain kept falling, and the men straggled.
Yesterday afternoon the warrior Sparks had dropped
behind. He had pains in his joints, which the medicine-man
had not been able to cure: “rheumatism.”
He could not ride a horse and he could scarcely
walk, using his gun as a crutch. Last night he had
not come into camp. The Spanish trail was lost,
again; and Sparks was lost, too.</p>

<p>Scar Head was glad to go back and look for him.
He liked Sparks. He liked all the men and was
getting to know them by their names: queer names.
Each man had two—one for each other and one
for the chiefs. There was “Jake” and “Carter”;
the same man. And “Jerry” and “Jackson”; and
“Tom” and “Dougherty”; and “John” and
“Brown”; and “Hugh” and “Menaugh”; and
“Bill” and “Meek”; and “Joe” and “Ballenger”;
and the others. The last two were head warriors,
called “sergeant.” The medicine-man’s names were
“John” and “Doctor Robinson.” The second
chief’s names were “the left’nant” and “Lieutenant
Wilkinson.” Chief Pike was “the cap’n” and
“Lieutenant Pike.”</p>

<p>The warriors spoke only American, but they
knew Indian ways. The most of them, Baroney said,
had been on a long journey before with Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
Pike, far into the north up a great river, into the
country of the Sioux.</p>

<p>The medicine-man, Doctor Robinson, was popular,
but he was not a chief. The men did not seem
to fear him. He rode well and shot well. Lieutenant
Pike and he rode and hunted together, while the
second chief, Lieutenant Wilkinson, stayed with the
men. Scar Head also had grown not to fear the
medicine-man, who frequently asked him about his
white spot and where he had come from, to the
Utahs and Pawnees, and tried to teach him American
words.</p>

<p>Some of the American words were hard and some
easy. On some days they were harder than on other
days; and again Scar Head suddenly spoke words
that he didn’t know at all—they arrived to him of
themselves. That was odd. He was getting to be
an American; he felt as though he had been an
American in his heart all the time, but that his heart
had been shut up. The times when his spot throbbed
and burned were the times when he knew the fewest
words.</p>

<p>The men had given him a new name. His Pawnee
name was not good enough for them. The new name
was “Stub.” John Sparks had told him of it, first,
by saying it.</p>

<p>“Hello, Stub? How goes it, Stub?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>And the other men laughed and repeated:</p>

<p>“Here, Stub.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Stub!”</p>

<p>“You’re the boy, Stub.”</p>

<p>“What is ‘Stub’?” he asked, of the medicine-man,
Doctor Robinson.</p>

<p>“It is ‘short,’ ‘cut off,’ coupé,” carefully explained
the medicine-man. “They like you. It is a
good name, because you are small.”</p>

<p>“American?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Sure, an’ we mane no harm, doctor, sir,” called
“Tom,” whose other name was Dougherty. “If
sawed-off he is, a rale little man he is, too.”</p>

<p>And while Scar Head (whose other name was
now “Stub,” in American language) did not understand
all those words, he knew that they were kindly
spoken. So his name pleased him.</p>

<p>John Brown was the man who rode with him
to look for Sparks. They took the back trail and
rode for a long time. Everything was wet from the
rains. Sparks must have spent a miserable night,
alone on the prairie, without food or fire. Finally
they saw him, far ahead, hobbling slowly, trying to
catch up with the march.</p>

<p>He grinned when they met him, and shouted
cheerfully, although he made faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>“Mornin’ to ye, boys. ’Rah for Stub!”</p>

<p>“H’lo, John. No walk; ride. My pony.” And
Stub sprang off.</p>

<p>“Can you ride, John?” asked John Brown.</p>

<p>“Sure, I’ll try. At this rate I dunno whether
I’m goin’ or comin’. You’ll all be to the mountains
an’ back ag’in before I ever ketch up. Hey, Stub?”</p>

<p>But Stub might only smile.</p>

<p>With many grunts and awkward movements
John Sparks climbed aboard the yellow pony. It
was near noon when they brought him into the camp.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pike and Doctor Robinson had been
hunting for the Spanish trail, again, but had not
found it. There was talk of a large river, the Arkansaw,
somewhere southward yet. The Americans
were anxious to reach the river, which would guide
them; but they had lost the trail to it.</p>

<p>After eating, they made another march. When
the sun was low, Lieutenant Pike pointed to some
trees a long way ahead and told Lieutenant Wilkinson
to march the men to that place. He beckoned
to Stub.</p>

<p>“Come with me?” he asked.</p>

<p>Stub nodded. He and Lieutenant Pike and Doctor
the medicine-man went off by themselves, scouting
up a creek. Lieutenant Pike was still looking
for the Spanish trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>They all looked and looked, but did not cross
it. The lieutenant sighted some buffalo; he and the
medicine-man gave chase, and before Stub reached
them they had killed two. That was good. They
took the tongues, and left a coat on the carcasses, to
keep the wolves away; but when the three rode
hard, to get to camp before dark, there was no camp.
The Lieutenant Wilkinson men had not gone to the
trees. Now everybody was lost!</p>

<p>After searching about and speaking angrily,
Lieutenant Pike ordered camp. It was lucky that
they had taken the buffalo tongues, because now
they might make a fire and cook the tongues.</p>

<p>What had become of the Lieutenant Wilkinson
men seemed very queer. Early in the morning
Lieutenant Pike led up the creek, from the trees, and
did not find them. The three arrived at the spot
where the two buffalo carcasses were lying. The
wolves were eating the carcasses, in spite of the
coat, but there were marrow bones left. Next, the
lieutenant led down the creek. Not even the smoke
of any campfires might be seen, and there were no
pony tracks or footprints.</p>

<p>Stub used all his eyes, but discovered nothing.
At night the lieutenant and the doctor were much
worried.</p>

<p>“Injuns, mebbe?” Stub asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>Lieutenant Pike nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“I fear so. We will hunt more to-morrow.”</p>

<p>That night it rained, and in the morning was still
raining, cold. But they had had plenty to eat. This
day they rode and rode, up the creek again, in the
rain.</p>

<p>“It is bad,” said the doctor. “A long way from
home. Only four shots left. No trail, no men,
nada (nothing). Indian country. We look one
more day; then we find the river Arkansaw.”</p>

<p>“Go to ’Nited States?” Stub queried.</p>

<p>“Cannot tell. The Great Father sent us out.
We are men; we hate to go back.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe they there, on Arkansaw. Injuns chase
’em.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. But it is bad. Maybe Injuns chase us,
next.”</p>

<p>“We fight,” declared Stub.</p>

<p>And the doctor laughed.</p>

<p>“You’re all right. We’ll do our best, eh?”</p>

<p>Stub had ten arrows; the lieutenant and the
medicine-man each had four loads for their guns.
That was not much, in a fight.</p>

<p>Early in the morning they again rode, searching
up the creek, with their eyes scanning before and
behind and right and left. When the sun was halfway<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
to noon, they saw two horsemen, coming from
the south. Indians? No! White men—soldiers!</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pike cried gladly, and fired his gun,
in signal. His face had been dark and stern; now
it lighted up, and they all galloped for the two men.
Lieutenant Wilkinson was only three miles south,
on the Arkansaw.</p>

<p>“What! The Arkansaw?” Lieutenant Pike
repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It is right close.”</p>

<p>“Have you found the Spanish trail?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. But we found the river.”</p>

<p>The two soldiers guided. When they drew near
where the river was, Lieutenant Wilkinson galloped
out. By the way in which he shook hands with his
chief and with the doctor, he, too, had been worried.</p>

<p>“Sure, we thought you were lost or scalped,”
said John Sparks, to Stub, in camp.</p>

<p>“No lost; you lost,” answered Stub.</p>

<p>“Well, depends on how you look at it,” agreed
John Sparks, scratching his red hair.</p>

<p>The river was a wide river, flowing between cottonwood
trees. The country was flat, and the trees
had hidden the size of the river. The men began to
look for trees to make boats of. Did this mean
that Chief Pike was going to travel on by boat?
Baroney explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>“Lieutenant Wilkinson travels down river by
boat. The captain takes men and marches to the
Comanches.”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Wilkinson, how far?” Stub asked.</p>

<p>“Very far, to the American forts at the mouth
of the river, and to report to the American father.”</p>

<p>“Captain Pike, how far?”</p>

<p>Baroney shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Who knows?”</p>

<p>Stub made up his mind what <em>he</em> was going to do.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pike moved the camp to the other
side of the river, where the best boat-trees grew.
The river was rising fast, from the rains, and everybody
had to swim and arrived very wet. Rain fell
almost all the time, but it was a good camp, with
plenty of wood and meat.</p>

<p>While the men under Lieutenant Wilkinson cut
down trees Chief Pike and the doctor medicine-man
scouted up and down the river, hunting meat and the
Spanish trail. There were buffalo and antelope, but
there was no Spanish trail.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pike grew curious about the wish-ton-wish,
or prairie dogs. He found a large town
of them, where the rattle-snakes and the tortoise
lived, too. He and the doctor shot them, to eat, and
they were good—as Stub well knew. It took true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
shooting, because unless a wish-ton-wish is killed
dead, he crawls into his hole.</p>

<p>The wish-ton-wish is among the smartest of animals.
He digs his hole cunningly. The lieutenant
and the doctor tried to fill one hole with water, and
get the wish-ton-wish that way. Stub said, “No
use”—he and the Pawnee boys had tried it often.
And the men found out that this was true, for they
spent a long time and poured in one hundred and
forty kettles of water, and it all disappeared but no
wish-ton-wish came out.</p>

<p>Still, the towns were interesting places, where
the dogs sat up straight with their hands across their
stomachs, and held councils, like people, and whistled
“Wish-ton-wish (Look out)!” whenever an enemy
was sighted.</p>

<p>A great deal of buffalo-meat was dried, for Lieutenant
Wilkinson to take. Making the boats required
several days. The trees were too small and soft.
When one boat had at last been hollowed the men
started to build another out of buffalo and elk hides,
stretched over a frame.</p>

<p>On the night before Lieutenant Wilkinson was to
leave, Chief Pike the captain said to Stub:</p>

<p>“Come here. Listen.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“To-morrow you go with Lieutenant Wilkinson.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Stub. He had been afraid of
that.</p>

<p>“Yes. You go with him, to the United States.
That is best.”</p>

<p>“No.” And Stub shook his head.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“No go. Stay with you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to be an American, and see
the towns of the Great Father?”</p>

<p>“Be an American here,” answered Stub.</p>

<p>“We do not stay here. We go on, a long way,
up the river, to the mountains.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Stub.</p>

<p>“You will be cold.”</p>

<p>“Don’t care.”</p>

<p>“You will be hungry.”</p>

<p>“Don’t care.”</p>

<p>“We may all die.”</p>

<p>“Don’t care.”</p>

<p>“The Osage were afraid. The Pawnee were
afraid. You are not afraid?”</p>

<p>“No. No Osage, no Pawnee; American.
March, hunt, fight, stay with you,” Stub appealed,
eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>The doctor medicine-man laughed, and clapped
him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Good. Let him come, lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“He may come,” replied the lieutenant. And
Stub’s heart beat gladly.</p>

<p>Baroney and John Sparks and Tom Dougherty
and John Brown and others of his friends were
coming, too. Had he been sent away with Lieutenant
Wilkinson, in the boat, for the United States,
he would have run off at his first chance and followed
the Pike trail.</p>

<p>Right after breakfast in the morning camp was
broken. It had been a very cold night, with snow,
and ice floated thickly down the swollen river. But
by help of the Wilkinson boats Lieutenant Pike
moved his men and baggage across the river again,
to the north side which everybody said was the
American side. The men worked hard, to load
the boats and swim the horses, in the slush and ice.
Then Lieutenant Wilkinson made ready to start.</p>

<p>He took with him, in his two boats, one of the
head soldiers, Sergeant Joe Ballenger; the soldiers
John Boley, Sam Bradley, Sol Huddleston, and John
Wilson; the Osage man and woman who had come
this far, and corn and meat for twenty-one days.</p>

<p>Head soldier Sergeant Bill Meek marched the
Pike men up-river, but Stub stayed with Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Pike, the doctor, and Baroney, to see the Wilkinson
men leave. He had no fear of being put aboard, now,
for Chief Pike always spoke the truth.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Wilkinson shook hands all ’round,
stepped into the boat, made of four buffalo hides and
two elk hides, and with his crew pushed off, after
the other boat. The floating ice did not matter.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pike watched them out of sight, in a
bend. Then he turned his horse toward the west.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said.</p>

<p>He and Doctor Robinson led; Baroney and Stub
followed.</p>

<p>“Now to the mountains,” cheered Baroney.
“Huzzah!”</p>

<p>“Huzzah!” Stub echoed.</p>

<p>The mountains were far, through Comanche
country, maybe through Spanish country, perhaps
into Utah country; and after that, what? Nobody
had said. Winter was here, as if the Great Spirit
were still angry. The men had shivered, this morning,
in their thin clothes; but nobody had seemed to
care. Young Chief Wilkinson, with a few men, was
going one way, on an unknown trail; young Chief
Pike, with the rest of the men, was going the other
way, on another unknown trail. So, huzzah! To be
an American one must be brave.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII<br />
<small>“THE MOUNTAINS! THE MOUNTAINS!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Spanish trail again! They struck it toward
evening of the day after Lieutenant Wilkinson
had left—and they struck it just in time, too. Snow
was falling once more, and dusk was at hand.</p>

<p>The trail came in from the north, and crossed the
river. Lieutenant Pike ordered camp made. Then
he and the doctor forded the river, through the floating
ice, to see where the trail went on the other side.</p>

<p>They returned in the dark. They had lost the
trail, among the buffalo tracks, but were going to try
again in the morning.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to take Stub, and use his eyes, too,”
said the doctor.</p>

<p>This was another cold night. The snow had quit,
after falling two inches deep. The horses groaned,
where they were picketed to graze; before rolling
themselves in their blankets and buffalo robes, on the
ground, the men huddled about their fires. There
were now thirteen soldiers, and Chief Pike, the doctor,
Baroney and Stub.</p>

<p>“Heap winter, b’gorry; eh?” spoke Pat Smith,
to Stub, and holding his hands to the blaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>Stub gravely nodded.</p>

<p>“Winter come soon,” he answered.</p>

<p>“An’ aren’t ye cold, boy?” queried John Sparks.
“In only your skin an’ a buff’lo robe?”</p>

<p>“No cold,” Stub asserted. That was all the
Pawnees wore. He was used to it.</p>

<p>The day dawned clear. After eating, Sergeant
Meek marched the men up along the river. With
Lieutenant Pike and the doctor, Stub crossed to
help find the Spanish trail. They had to break a
way through the ice. The ice cut the horses’ legs, the
stinging water splashed high, soaking moccasins and
drenching the lieutenant and the doctor above the
knees. The lieutenant wore thin blue cotton leggins—a
sort of trousers called overalls; now these
clung to him tightly.</p>

<p>Stub rather preferred his own skin, for it shed
water.</p>

<p>The Spanish had camped over here. There were
lots of horse sign showing through the snow, in a
space of more than a mile. The Spanish seemed to
have grown in numbers. It was an old camp, and
the trail out of it had been flattened by buffalo tracks,
and by the snows and rains. So they three—Lieutenant
Pike, the doctor, and Stub—made circles, as
they rode up river, to cut the trail farther on.</p>

<p>They did not find it until noon. But they found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
something else: Indian signs which were not older
than three days. A party of warriors were ahead.
Stub picked up a worn moccasin: “Pawnee—Grand
Pawnee,” he announced, when he handed it to the
lieutenant “War party. All on foot. Mebbe so
many.” And he opened and shut his fingers five
times.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor examined the
moccasin. After that they rode more rapidly, as if
anxious to get to their soldiers.</p>

<p>The soldiers also had crossed the river, on
account of bad travel, and were camped on this, the
south side. In the morning they all marched by the
Spanish trail, along the river, into the west, over a
country covered with salt. There were more Indian
signs. It looked as though twenty warriors had been
marching in the same direction only a short time
before; and fresh horse tracks pointed down river.</p>

<p>Whether the Indians were the same Pawnees or
not, was hard to tell. But the horse tracks looked to
be wild-horse tracks.</p>

<p>“Sure, wouldn’t it be fun to ketch a few o’ them
wild hosses, Stub, lad?” proposed John Sparks, in
camp. “We need ’em. Would ye know how?”</p>

<p>“Chase ’em; with rope. Chase ’em all day, make
tired, mebbe no ketch ’em,” Stub answered.</p>

<p>“Or if ye shoot one jest right, through the nape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
o’ the neck an’ graze the nerve there, ye’ll down him
like as if lightning struck him an’ he won’t be hurt,”
asserted Hugh Menaugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it takes mighty fine shootin’,” said
soldier Bill Gordon. “You’re like to kill him, or
miss him complete.”</p>

<p>The wild horses were sighted the next evening,
from camp on an island where there was wood and
shelter. The lieutenant and the doctor and Baroney
had come in with two antelope that they had killed
among their own horses, while they themselves were
lying on the ground and resting. They might have
killed more, but they did not need the meat. Now
while spying on the country around, through his
long glass, the lieutenant saw a bunch of moving
figures out there on the prairie, north of the river.</p>

<p>Indians? No—wild horses, more than one hundred!
Good! Out he went, and the doctor, and
Baroney, and Stub followed, to get a nearer view.</p>

<p>They were of many colors, those wild horses—blacks
and browns and greys and spotted. They
waited with heads high, as curious as if they had
never seen men before. Then they came charging,
in a broad front, and their hoofs drummed like
thunder. Only a short way off they stopped, to
start and snort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>“Ma foi, quelle beauté (My gracious, how beautiful)!”
cried Baroney.</p>

<p>“Try to crease that black, lieutenant,” the doctor
proposed.</p>

<p>The lieutenant rested his gun upon his empty saddle,
took long aim, and fired. But he did not stun
the black—he missed him entirely—he had not dared
to draw fine enough.</p>

<p>At that, around the wild horses wheeled, as if by
command, and pelted off, to halt and gaze again.</p>

<p>“To-morrow we’ll see if we can run some down,”
said the lieutenant. “Shall we, Stub?”</p>

<p>“Pawnee sometimes run all day. Mebbe ketch
one, mebbe not. Too swift, have too much wind.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can try,” laughed the doctor.</p>

<p>The camp was excited, to-night, with the thought
of catching wild horses. The men busied themselves
tying nooses in their picket ropes.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t a critter that could ketch a
badger,” John Sparks complained; “unless it be the
doctor’s black an’ that yaller pony o’ Stub’s.”</p>

<p>Stub doubted very much whether his yellow pony
would amount to anything, in racing wild horses.
The Pawnees always used two or three horses, each,
so as to tire the wild horses out.</p>

<p>However, the lieutenant was bound to try. In
the morning he picked out the six best horses, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
included the yellow pony, and appointed the riders.
They were himself, the doctor, Baroney, soldier
John Sparks, soldier Freegift Stout, and Stub. Only
Baroney and Stub had seen wild horses chased
before.</p>

<p>All the camp, except the camp guards, followed.
The wild horses were in about the same place, a mile
distant. They waited, curious, pawing and snorting
and speaking to the tame horses, until within short
bow shot, or forty steps. On a sudden they wheeled.</p>

<p>“After ’em!” the lieutenant shouted.</p>

<p>“Hooray!”</p>

<p>Ah, but that was sport! Stub’s yellow pony
sprang to the fore; he was nimble and he carried
light. No—another horse and rider forged alongside
him. They were the medicine-man and his
black; a good rider and a good horse.</p>

<p>Stub hammered and yelled. “Hi! Hi! Hi!”
The doctor lashed and yelled. Already they had
gained the heels of the flying herd. The clods of
earth thrown by the rapid hoofs bombarded them
lustily. Baroney and soldier Sparks and soldier
Stout, and even the lieutenant had been dropped
behind.</p>

<p>But working hard, they two never got quite far
enough in, to cast the ropes. The wild horses were
playing with them. After about two miles the yellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
pony and the doctor’s horse began to wheeze
and to tire; the wild band were running as strongly
as ever—only romping along, biting and kicking
at each other. Then as if to show what they really
could do, led by their black stallion, they lengthened
their strides, opened the gap wider and wider, and
were away.</p>

<p>The doctor hauled short.</p>

<p>“No use, Stub,” he called.</p>

<p>So Stub pulled down, and turned.</p>

<p>“No use,” he agreed. “But heap fun.”</p>

<p>“You bet!” pronounced the doctor, panting.
“What do you say ‘heap’ fun for? That’s not
American; that’s Injun. Americans say ‘much’ fun,
or ‘great’ fun.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Stub admitted—for the doctor
knew. “Heap chase wild horse, much fun.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” the doctor laughed. “If I could
only get into that head of yours I’d take the ‘heaps’
out of it. How’s your white spot, these days? Burn
any?”</p>

<p>“Some days burn, some days no. Some days
heavy, some days light.” And with that, Stub kept
his distance. He wished that the doctor would quit
talking about “getting into” his head. A medicine-man
had dangerous power.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and Baroney and the two soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
had come as fast as they could. There was a great
deal of laughing and joking as the doctor and Stub
joined them, and all rode back for the main party,
and camp. The lieutenant joked the least. He
never did joke much, anyway; he was stern and
quiet.</p>

<p>“We’ll delay no more for wild horses, men,” he
said. “Our Country expects something better of
us than such child’s play at the impossible. Forward
again, now. We will hunt only for food, in line of
duty.”</p>

<p>This afternoon they marched thirteen miles.</p>

<p>The Spanish trail continued, up the river, and
ever westward. It was a pity that some of the
wild horses had not been caught, for the other horses
were beginning to give out. The grass was short
and thin, and eaten off by the buffalo, and at night
the men cut cottonwood boughs for the horses to
feed upon.</p>

<p>This was a rich meat country, though. Buffalo
were constantly in sight, by the thousand, many of
them fat cows, and the hunters brought in humps
and tongues. The Spanish had left camp signs—at
one camp almost one hundred fires might be counted,
meaning six hundred or seven hundred warriors. A
whole Spanish army had been through here, but the
lieutenant and his little army of sixteen marched on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>There were several old camp-places of Indians.
One showed Comanche signs; near by, the Spanish
also had camped, as if making ready to meet the
Comanches, and Baroney and the lieutenant thought
that the Comanche range must be close at hand.</p>

<p>But where were the mountains? How far were
the mountains, now? The river was getting narrower
and deeper, the country higher and rougher.
Two horses became so weak that they could not
carry their packs. The horses had been traveling,
starved and foot-sore, under heavy loads more than
twenty miles a day.</p>

<p>John Sparks, who had been out hunting, returned
with news.</p>

<p>“I sighted an Injun hossback,” he reported.
“He made off up a little ravine south of us. Don’t
know whether he saw me or not.”</p>

<p>Before night fresh moccasin tracks not over a
few hours old were discovered. A large war party
were somewhere just ahead. This night the camp
guards were doubled, but nothing happened.</p>

<p>In the morning the lieutenant took the doctor,
John Sparks, and Stub for interpreter, and circled
south, to find the lone horseman. Only his tracks
were found; so they rode back again and the column
marched on.</p>

<p>Nothing special occurred today, but everybody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
kept sharp lookout. The country was lonely, broken
by rocky spurs and uplifts, and the buffalo herds
seemed to be less in number.</p>

<p>The next day the lieutenant and the doctor led,
as usual, with Baroney and Stub behind them, and
the column of toiling men and horses under Sergeant
Meek, following. The two weak horses had fallen
down, to die, and another was barely able to walk.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pike frequently used his spy-glass,
which made things ten miles off appear to be only a
few steps. In the middle of the day he halted and
leveled it long.</p>

<p>“Sees something,” said Baroney, in French.</p>

<p>In a moment the lieutenant galloped forward to
the doctor, who had gone on, and they both looked.
But they did not signal, and they did not come back;
so what it was that they thought they saw, nobody
knew. Stub and Baroney strained their eyes, seeking.
Aha!</p>

<p>“Smoke sign,” uttered Baroney.</p>

<p>“Heap smoke. Big fire. Mebbe cloud,” Stub
answered.</p>

<p>From the little rise they could just descry, far,
far to the northwest, a tiny tip of bluish color,
jutting into the horizon there. It did not move, it
did not swell nor waver. No smoke, then; cloud—the
upper edge of a cloud. The lieutenant and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
doctor had read it, and were riding on. In another
minute it had sunk, swallowed by the land before.</p>

<p>“N’importe (does not matter),” murmured
Baroney. “Perhaps more snow, my gracious! But
who cares?”</p>

<p>In about two miles more, the lieutenant and the
doctor halted again, on the top of a low hill that
cut the way. They gazed, through the spy-glass,
examining ahead. They did not leave the hill.
They stayed—and the lieutenant waved his hat. He
had seen something, for sure. Baroney and Stub
were a quarter of a mile from him. The soldiers
were a quarter of a mile farther.</p>

<p>“Come! He signals,” rapped Baroney. Now he
and Stub galloped, to find out. Behind, the soldiers’
column quickened pace, for the orders of Sergeant
Meek might be heard, as he shouted them.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor were gazing once
more, with eyes and spy-glass both.</p>

<p>“What is it? The savages?” cried Baroney,
as he and Stub raced in, up to the top of the flat hill.</p>

<p>Or the Spanish? The Spanish trail had been
lost, for the past day or two. Maybe the Spanish
were encamped, and waiting. The lieutenant
answered.</p>

<p>“No. The mountains, my man! The mountains,
at last!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cheered the doctor. “See them?”</p>

<p>Baroney stared. Stub stared. It was the same
bluish cloud, only larger and plainer. It jutted
sharply—no, it sort of floated, but it did not move.
It was fastened to the earth. And north from it
there extended a long line of other clouds, lower, as
far as one might see; while southward from it were
still lower clouds, tapering off.</p>

<p>“One big mountain! A giant! Ma foi, how
big!” Baroney gasped.</p>

<p>“All mountains. The Mexican mountains, on
the edge of the United States,” announced the lieutenant.
“Take the glass. Look—you and Stub.”</p>

<p>Look they did. The spy-glass worked wonders.
It brought the clouds much closer, and broke them.
They were no longer clouds—they changed to mountains
indeed. In the spy-glass they shimmered
whitely. That was snow! Or white rocks! They
were medicine mountains. And the big mountain, so
high, so mysterious, so proud: a chief mountain.</p>

<p>“You have been there?” asked the doctor, eagerly,
of Stub. “With the Utahs?”</p>

<p>“No.” And Stub shook his head. “Not there.
No remember.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” the doctor answered.</p>

<p>The column came panting up. The doctor and
the lieutenant again waved their hats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“The mountains, men! You see the Mexican
mountains—the Great Stony Mountains. Three
cheers, now, for the Mexican mountains!”</p>

<p>Everybody cheered three times: “Hooray!
Hooray! Hooray!” Only the horses stood with
heads drooping; they did not care.</p>

<p>“How far, would you think, cap’n?” Sergeant
Meek queried.</p>

<p>“We ought to reach their base day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!”</p>

<p>But although they all marched ten more miles
to-day, and more than eleven miles the next day,
and more than twenty-three miles the next day,
from camp on the third evening the big chief mountain
and the lesser mountains seemed no nearer than
before.</p>

<p>“Sure, they’re marchin’ faster’n we are,” said
John Sparks.</p>

<p>“Spirit mountains,” Stub decided. “See ’em,
no get ’em.”</p>

<p>Another horse was about to die. There were
fresh Indian signs, again. The Spanish trail had
been found—it led onward, toward the mountains.
The country was growing more bare, the air thinner
and chillier. Through the spy-glass the mountains
looked bare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>When the next herd of buffalo were seen, the
lieutenant ordered camp made, and sent hunters out
to kill meat enough for several days. There might
be no buffalo, farther on. It was a poor country.
He himself did not hunt. He went up on a hill and
drew pictures of the mountains, on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>Stub did not hunt, either; he was almost out
of arrows. He followed Lieutenant Pike to the
hill, and watched him. But the pictures were only
crooked lines, like Indian pictures.</p>

<p>The lieutenant glanced aside at him, and smiled.
His smile was sweet, when he did smile.</p>

<p>“Would you like to climb that big blue mountain?”
he asked.</p>

<p>Stub had to think, a moment. The big blue
mountain! Yes, big and blue it was—and white;
and very far. The thunder spirit might live there.
Winter lived there. Could anybody climb it? It
never was out of sight, now, except at night (and
it never was out of sight, for days and days afterward),
but it seemed hard to reach.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> This was the celebrated Pike’s Peak, of Colorado, later
named for Lieutenant Pike, first white man to tell about it.</p>

</div>

<p>“Top?”</p>

<p>“Yes, clear to the top,” smiled the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Stub’s eyes widened; and he smiled also.</p>

<p>“Sure. No afraid, with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“Good!” the lieutenant praised. “We’ll see.”</p>

<p>The hunters killed seventeen buffalo, and
wounded many more. When the best of the meat
had been smoked, there were nine hundred pounds
of it, and one hundred and thirty-six marrow-bones.
The camp finished off the marrow-bones in one
meal, as a feast before marching on to storm the
big blue mountain.</p>

<small>BAD HEARTS IN THE WAY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Des sauvages (Indians)!”</p>

<p>Thus Baroney shouted, pointing, from where he
had checked his horse on the edge of a little rise
overlooking a dip in the trail.</p>

<p>They all had been marching two more days,
and had covered about forty more miles. This
made seven days’ travel, counting the two days of
meat camp, and eighty-five miles, since the Big
Blue Mountain had first been sighted. Now it and
the lesser mountains were much plainer.</p>

<p>But here were the Indians, sure enough. The
lieutenant had rather been expecting them. Yesterday
the fresh tracks of the two men, again, had
given warning. So the column were marching close
together.</p>

<p>The Indians, on foot, were running toward the
column, from some trees on the river bank, at the
right.</p>

<p>“Close up, men,” the lieutenant ordered.</p>

<p>“Close up, close up! Look to your priming!”
ordered Sergeant Meek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>And the lieutenant and the doctor, with Baroney
and Stub ready to interpret for them, led for the
Indians.</p>

<p>“Pawnee, hein (hey)?” said Baroney.</p>

<p>“No Republic Pawnee; Grand Pawnee. War
party; no horses,” Stub explained. There was a
difference between the Republic Pawnees and the
Grand Pawnees.</p>

<p>“Others yonder, lieutenant!” exclaimed the
doctor.</p>

<p>They looked. Another squad of the Indians were
running down from a hill on the left. They carried
flags on lances—the Grand Pawnee war colors.</p>

<p>“Make a surround!” guessed Baroney.</p>

<p>The lieutenant reined his horse, and drew his
curved sword.</p>

<p>“Company, halt! Watch sharp, men!”</p>

<p>He glanced right and left, waiting to see if this
was an attack. No—for, as the doctor suddenly
said:</p>

<p>“Those first fellows act friendly, lieutenant.
They have no arms; they’re holding out empty
hands.”</p>

<p>“Forward!” ordered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>In a minute more they met the Indians from the
timber. These Pawnees did indeed act friendly—and
all too friendly! They crowded in among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
soldiers, shaking hands, putting their arms around
the soldiers’ necks, even trying to hug the lieutenant
and the doctor and Baroney and the others who
rode horseback.</p>

<p>The lieutenant got off, good-naturedly; instantly
a Pawnee leaped into the saddle and rode the horse
away. The doctor and Baroney lost their horses,
also; Stub (who knew what the Pawnees were up
to) was almost dragged down, but he stuck fast.</p>

<p>All was in confusion of laughter and jostling
and pretended play.</p>

<p>“No, no!” the lieutenant objected, growing
angry; and half drew a pistol. The men were getting
together, wresting their guns from the Pawnees’
hands and holding them high, to keep them free.</p>

<p>More Pawnees, from the timber, had joined,
with guns and bows and lances; and the Pawnees
from the hillside had come in. They included two
chiefs.</p>

<p>The two chiefs issued orders, and the play
stopped. The horses were returned. Then all went
on to the trees by the river, for a talk.</p>

<p>Here matters again looked bad. The warriors
frolicked, in spite of the chiefs. They were Grand
Pawnees—sixty: a war party out to plunder the
Padoucahs. But they had not found any Padoucahs;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
so this seemed a good chance to plunder somebody
else, instead of returning home empty-handed.</p>

<p>The lieutenant’s face was red, as he angrily
warded off the hands that clutched at his pistols and
gun and horse’s bridle.</p>

<p>“Stand firm, men!” he called. “Don’t let loose
of a thing—don’t let them get behind us!”</p>

<p>“Kape your distance, you red rascals!” rasped
Tom Dougherty, as they hustled him about.</p>

<p>“Steady! Steady!” Sergeant Meek cautioned.</p>

<p>“By thunder, they’d like to strip us,” the doctor
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Even Stub objected vigorously, in Pawnee. The
Grand Pawnees were indeed rascals.</p>

<p>Guns were being cocked—click, click; several of
the Pawnees, angry themselves, leveled bended bows.
It was likely to be a fight between the sixteen Americans
and the sixty Pawnees; and Stub sat alert, ready
to pluck an arrow as quick as lightning.</p>

<p>“Guard those packs, men!” the lieutenant kept
shouting.</p>

<p>But the two chiefs were working hard, shoving
the warriors back, clearing a space. The head chief
spoke to the lieutenant, and signed.</p>

<p>“He says: ‘Let us talk,’” Baroney interpreted.</p>

<p>“Very well. Tell him we will talk or we will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
fight,” replied the lieutenant. “We won’t be robbed.
If it is peace, we will give him presents.”</p>

<p>They all sat down in a ring, with the lieutenant
and Baroney and the two chiefs in the center. The
Americans sat under the American flag, the Pawnee
warriors sat under the Grand Pawnee flags. The
doctor, however, stood up, watching everything.</p>

<p>The Pawnee head chief took out a pipe and
tobacco, for a peace smoke. That looked good. But
before filling the pipe, the two chiefs made speeches.</p>

<p>“They ask what presents you will give them.
They say they are poor,” Baroney translated. And
that was what they had said.</p>

<p>“Bring half a bale of tobacco, a dozen knives,
and flints and steels enough for all, sergeant,” the
lieutenant ordered.</p>

<p>The head chief made another speech. He was
refusing the presents. He asked for corn, powder
and lead, blankets, kettles—all kinds of stuff.</p>

<p>“Tell him that there are our presents. We have
nothing else for him,” the lieutenant answered.
“We are ready to smoke with him.”</p>

<p>The chief did not lift the pipe. He and the other
chief sat, with bad spirit showing in their eyes. The
warriors commenced to hoot, and handle their guns
and bows again.</p>

<p>“He will not smoke such poor presents,” Baroney<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
reported. “I think they mean trouble. A little
tobacco, lieutenant; maybe a little tobacco and
powder.”</p>

<p>“You had best look out, lieutenant,” warned
the doctor. “I don’t like their looks.”</p>

<p>“Tell the chief he will get nothing else. He can
take those presents or leave them,” bade the lieutenant,
to Baroney.</p>

<p>Baroney hated to do it, but he had to obey. The
head chief scowled. Then he signed, and an old
man lugged in a kettle of water, as a return present.</p>

<p>Stub heard the Pawnee warriors talking scornfully.</p>

<p>“See what manner of men these white men are,
with their rags and their poor gifts,” they said.
“They do not travel like the Spanish. They look
like beggars.”</p>

<p>But Stub well knew that although their horses
were thin and sore, and they themselves were lean
and tattered and almost barefoot, these Americans
could fight.</p>

<p>Now Chief Pike and the two Pawnee chiefs
drank from the kettle of water, out of their hands,
and smoked the pipe, and ate a little dried buffalo
meat. Several Indians were called upon by the chief,
to pass the knives and flints and steels around. Indians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
who were given the presents threw them upon
the ground.</p>

<p>The lieutenant shook hands with the chiefs, and
rose.</p>

<p>“All ready, doctor,” he called. “Pack your
animals, sergeant, where necessary. We march.”</p>

<p>The Pawnees sprang up, too, and crowded forward
again.</p>

<p>“They make a surround,” said Baroney.</p>

<p>“Look out, lieutenant! They’re stealing your
pistols—mine, too!” cried the doctor.</p>

<p>The lieutenant leaped upon his horse just in time
to rescue his pistols, hanging from the saddle. He
was hemmed in. The soldiers were swearing and
darting back and forth, grabbing at thieves and
protecting the baggage also.</p>

<p>Now the lieutenant had lost his hatchet. He
exclaimed furiously.</p>

<p>“Tell the chief my hatchet is gone.”</p>

<p>The chief only said:</p>

<p>“These are small matters for a great man.”</p>

<p>He drew his buffalo robe high and turned his
back.</p>

<p>The lieutenant flushed, more angry still, and stiffened
in his saddle. He meant business. Stub had
seen him look this way before.</p>

<p>“Leave the baggage and get your men to one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
side, sergeant. Quick! Be ready with your guns.
That’s it. Baroney, tell the chief that the next warrior
who touches our baggage or animals shall die
instantly. Sergeant, at the first attempt, let the
men shoot to kill.”</p>

<p>The Pawnees understood. They saw the muskets
half leveled, and the grim, determined faces behind.
A warrior stretched out his hand, stealthily, to a
pack—and John Spark’s muzzle covered him in a
flash. He jumped back.</p>

<p>“Go!” suddenly ordered the head chief. The
Pawnees sullenly gathered their presents, and without
another word filed away, the whole sixty.</p>

<p>“See if we’ve lost anything, sergeant,” said the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“One sword, one tomahawk, one axe, five canteens
and some smaller stuff missing, sir,” was the
report.</p>

<p>The soldiers waited eagerly. They wished to follow
and fight.</p>

<p>“No matter,” gruffly answered the lieutenant.
“We must save our lives for our work, my men. We
have work to do. Forward, march.” He shrugged
his shoulders, and added, to the doctor: “I feel as
badly as they do. This is the first time I ever swallowed
an insult to the Government and the uniform.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
But our number is too small to risk failure of our
plans. Now for the mountains.”</p>

<p>“By gar, once more my scalp was loose,” said
Baroney, to Stub.</p>

<p>“Yes. They had black hearts, those Grand
Pawnee,” Stub gravely agreed.</p>

<p>This day they marched seventeen miles, and the
next day nineteen miles. In all they had come more
than one hundred and twenty miles, their eyes upon
the Big Blue Mountain, as the lieutenant called it.
And at last they had just about overtaken it.</p>

<p>From camp, here where the river split into two
large forks, one out of the west, the other out of the
south, the Big Blue Mountain looked to be quite
near, up a small north fork.</p>

<p>“Le Grand Mont,” Baroney called it. “The
Grand Peak.” And the men called it that, too.</p>

<p>“Sure, it can’t be more’n one day’s march now,”
John Sparks declared, as from camp they eyed it
again. “We can be there to-morrow at this time,
with ease, in case those be the orders.”</p>

<p>In the sunset the mountain loomed vast, its base
blue, but its top pinkish white. After everything
else was shrouded in dusk, its top still shone.</p>

<p>“How high, d’ye think?” queried soldier
Freegift Stout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>“Thray miles higher’n we be; mebbe four,”
guessed Pat Smith.</p>

<p>“He’s a grand wan all right,” sighed Tom
Dougherty. “Even a bur-rd wud nade an ixtra pair
o’ wings to get atop him, I’m thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“No mortal man, or nothing else on two legs
could do it, I reckon,” said John Brown. “Unless
that be the cap’n himself.”</p>

<p>“American can,” Stub reminded, proudly.</p>

<p>“You’re right, boy,” soldier Terry Miller approved.
“Under orders an American would come
pretty close to filling the job.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor had been gazing at
the peak; it fascinated them, like it fascinated the
men, and Stub. That night they talked together
until late, planning for to-morrow. The lieutenant
had decided to climb the mountain.</p>

<p>He sent for Sergeant Meek. The sergeant stood
before him and saluted.</p>

<p>“I intend to take Doctor Robinson and two of
the men, and this boy, to-morrow, and set out for
the big mountain,” the lieutenant said. “The camp
will be left in your charge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Sergeant Meek.</p>

<p>“These reports of the journey to date I also
leave, with my personal baggage. The mountain is
only a short day’s march, but I have to consider that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
we may be cut off or meet with other accident. To-morrow
morning I will lay out a stockade, here, for
the protection of your party. You are to wait here
one week, with due caution against surprises by the
savages and the Spanish. Admit nobody except
your own command into the stockade. If we do not
return or you do not hear from us within the seven
days, you are to take my papers and such baggage
as may be necessary, and march down river by the
safest direct course for the nearest American settlement
or military post, as may be. At the American
frontier you will leave your men under instructions
to report at St. Louis, and you will press ahead at
best speed and deliver my papers to General Wilkinson,
the head of the Army, wherever he may be. In
event of your disability, you will entrust the papers
to Corporal Jackson—acquainting him in advance
with what is expected of him. In the meantime, here
or on the march, keep your men alert and together,
and do not forget that our Country depends upon our
performing our duty without regard to our own
interests.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the sergeant. He gulped—the
ragged, weather-worn soldier. “Excuse me, sir—’tis
only a day’s march yonder, you say? You’ll
be coming back, sir?”</p>

<p>“If within human possibility, sergeant. But I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
must climb that mountain to its highest point, in
order to make certain of our position and ascertain
the trend of the various streams. We are near the
sources of the Arkansaw, as is evident. Our instructions
are to find the heads of the Arkansaw and the
Red River, on our way to the Comanches.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the sergeant.</p>

<p>“That is all. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, sir. I make bold to wish you good
luck, sir. I wish I might be going with you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sergeant.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant sat up late, writing. In his buffalo-robe,
Stub dreamed of to-morrow, and the
Grand Peak. He had understood only part of the
lieutenant’s long speech; but it was enough to understand
that he was to be taken.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IX">IX<br />
<small>A TRY AT THE “GRAND PEAK”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Early in the morning the lieutenant set the men
at work cutting down fourteen trees, for stockade
logs. A stockade was a fort. This fort was to be
only a pen, open on the river and five feet high on
the three other sides.</p>

<p>Soldiers John Brown and Terry Miller were the
men chosen. That made a party of five. They all
took only a blanket or robe apiece, and a little dried
meat, besides their guns and Stub’s bow and arrows.
They started horseback at one o’clock, to cross the
river and travel up the north fork, for the Grand
Peak.</p>

<p>The men paused long enough to give three cheers,
and wave their caps.</p>

<p>“Bon voyage (Good journey),” Baroney called.</p>

<p>“Good luck to yez.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be lookin’ for you back.”</p>

<p>“When ye get to the top, be lightin’ us a bonfire,
Terry.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant raised his hat, in reply. The
doctor waved, the two soldiers and Stub waved.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
And the five splashed through the ice-cold water
and left the eleven men under Sergeant Meek to
build the fort.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[B]</a> The fort was near present Pueblo, Colorado. Lieutenant
Pike’s squad marched up the west side of Fountain Creek.</p>

</div>

<p>According to the doctor, this was the twenty-fourth
day of the month named November. By the
morning light the Grand Peak, glistening white,
had looked to be nearer than ever. The lieutenant
was certain that a half-day’s march would bring
them to its base; to-morrow they would climb it,
and would be back in camp on the third day.</p>

<p>Mile after mile they hastened, their eyes scanning
the distance before. The route up along the small
fork was gravelly and bare, except for clumps of
sage brush, and the willows bordering the stream.
In places they had to cross deep washes cut by the
rains. Not a living thing was sighted, save rabbits
and prairie-dogs and a few antelope. And the
Grand Peak and the line of lesser peaks—some white,
some steel-gray, waited.</p>

<p>The sun sank low and lower, over their southern
end. The Grand Peak grew bluer and colder, and
the other mountains darkened.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor led. They always
rode together. Stub and soldiers Miller and Brown
followed close behind. After a while they all quit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
the stream, to strike westward, on a trail more direct.</p>

<p>Soldier Miller scratched his head, on which the
hair was long.</p>

<p>“It’s a queer thing, John,” he said. “There it
is, that peak—and there it’s been for more’n a hundred
miles, with us a-making for it and never reaching
it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll not reach it this day, that’s sure, lad,”
answered John. “We’ve covered ten miles, and
you’d think we’d been standin’ still!”</p>

<p>In two miles more the sun had set. The shadows
of the mountains seemed to extend out over the plain
and turn it dark and cold. Stub pulled his robe
closer around his neck. Now the Grand Peak had
changed to deep purple—it had pulled its own robe
up, for the night.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor suddenly veered
aside, to a single low cedar, the only tree of the kind,
around. There they halted and swung from their
saddles.</p>

<p>“We’ll make camp, men,” the lieutenant ordered.
“The base of the mountain evidently is farther than
we had figured. But we’ll reach it to-morrow morning,
easily, and doubtless the top also, before night.”</p>

<p>This was a cold camp—very cold with the breath
from the mountains. They had dried buffalo-meat
to chew on, but no water except that in the canteens,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
and the lieutenant wished to save on water, for the
climb.</p>

<p>He started them out again early, before sunrise.
They headed for the Grand Peak. The horses
were stiff, from the night, and thirsty, and moved
slowly at first. Presently the sun rose. The Grand
Peak flashed white in its beams, and assuredly was
near. The foothills at its base were dark green:
trees.</p>

<p>And there they stayed, the peak and the foothills,
all day! Stub’s eyes ached with gazing. Soldier
Brown grumbled a little.</p>

<p>“It’s a wild-goose chase. I’ve said that no man
will ever climb yon peak. We’ll wear out ourselves
and our hosses for nothin’. Even if we ever reach
the foot of it, look what’s ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“You may be sure the cap’n’ll climb it, whether
or no,” retorted soldier Miller. “He’s set out to do
it, and do it he will.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well; we’re gettin’ into a more likely country,
anyhow,” John granted. “The sign is better—that’s
one comfort.”</p>

<p>This was true. They were entering among low
hills, covered with cedars and pines. Up and down,
up and down, and winding over and through, they
hopefully pushed on—and from each rise they might
see the long dark-green slope of the Grand Peak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
more plainly. What a tremendous huge fellow he
was, as he towered, shadow-flecked, into the floating
clouds! The clouds veiled his top; he pierced them,
and thus he sat gazing above the world.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” murmured John Brown. “He’s a
neck-cracker.”</p>

<p>Toward evening the lieutenant and doctor, in
advance and just crossing another of the many rolling
hills, shouted back, and waved.</p>

<p>“Almost there, men!”</p>

<p>When the three others toiled up to the same
place, they saw. A shallow valley lay before; at the
farther edge the timbered slope of the Grand Peak
commenced.</p>

<p>Hurrah!</p>

<p>Several buffalo were feeding, below. The lieutenant
and the doctor made a dash for them—cleverly
headed them off, shot rapidly, and downed two.</p>

<p>“Fresh hump for supper,” cheered Terry. “I
could eat a whole one, myself.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I could drink a river dry, first,” wheezed
John. “Do you mind that we’ve struck no water
since mornin’?”</p>

<p>“Water there,” Stub hazarded, pointing at a
line of lighter green near the foot of the mountain.</p>

<p>They arrived below in time to help butcher the
buffalo while the lieutenant and the doctor rode on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
looking for a good camping place. It was too late
to do anything more this day.</p>

<p>A good camp spot was found on a little creek of
ice cold water from several springs flowing out of
the mountain’s base.</p>

<p>“Here we are at last, lads,” the lieutenant welcomed,
as they brought the meat in. “We’ve wood,
meat and water, and to-morrow we’ll climb to the
top. Success awaits us.”</p>

<p>“It’s been a long pull, eh?” laughed the doctor.
“How about you, Stub? Are you game? I mean,
are you ready to try?”</p>

<p>“I go,” Stub announced.</p>

<p>“With the cap’n’s permission we’ll all go, sir,”
added soldier Miller. “’Twill be a view worth the
seeing, up yonder above the clouds.”</p>

<p>“No tellin’ what we’ll find, I reckon,” put in
John Brown.</p>

<p>“Whatever happens, we’ll be content in the
knowledge that we’re losing no opportunity,” the
lieutenant declared. “When we stand up there, on
what may prove to be the uttermost southwestern
border of the United States, we will have extended
the authority of the Flag into a region doubtless
never before penetrated by man.”</p>

<p>“And procured considerable geographic information,”
said the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The Government will be enabled to
revise its atlases with accuracy, according to our
new data as to the course of certain rivers, and the
National boundary between the United States and
the Mexican territory westward. And we may perceive
a route that will take us directly from the
Arkansaw to the head of the Red River and the
Comanche country.”</p>

<p>The long slope of the mountain rose dark and
brooding right above them. They were so close in
that from the campfire they could not see the top,
but they felt the snow whitely waiting, up toward
the black sky beyond the million stiffly marshalled,
sighing pines.</p>

<p>Yes, cold it was, even here at the base; much
colder than last night, out on the plain. In spite of
the fire, their coverings were all too thin. At breakfast,
before sun-up in the morning, the lieutenant’s
instrument by which he read the cold said nine degrees
above freezing. In his moccasins, made from
a piece of his buffalo-robe, Stub’s feet tingled. Several
days back John Sparks had given him an old
pair of cotton trousers, cut off at the knees, but
these did not seem to amount to much, here. Still,
Terry Miller and John Brown had nothing better,
and their bare toes peeped through the holes in their
shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll leave the camp as it is,” the lieutenant
briskly ordered. “We’ll be back by night, so we’ll
not need our blankets or meat. See that the horses
are well staked, Miller, where they’ll be able to drink
and forage during the day.”</p>

<p>Doctor Robinson had gone outside for a minute.
They heard his gun. He came in, packing a partly
dressed deer.</p>

<p>“It’s a new kind, lieutenant,” he panted.</p>

<p>“Good. We’ll hang up the hide, to inspect later.”</p>

<p>The new kind of deer—a large deer with ears like
mule ears—was quickly butchered. They hung its
hide and the best of the meat upon a tree, until
their return at evening.</p>

<p>“Forward march, to the top, men,” the lieutenant
bade. “Take only your guns and ammunition.
Never mind the canteens. We’ll find plenty of water,
I’m sure. All ready, doctor?”</p>

<p>“All ready.”</p>

<p>With the lieutenant in the lead and Stub bringing
up the rear, they attacked the timbered slope. Puff,
puff! Wheeze, wheeze! The pine needles underfoot
and the frosty soil were slippery. Clouds veiled the
sky, the timber depths were dark and cold, but presently
they all were sweating. Gulches and draws cut
the way, so that by sliding down in and clambering
out, or else making circuits they lost much time.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
The mountain fought them with cliffs and canyons,
too, and sometimes they could scarcely make distance
on hands and knees. Now and then they had to
halt, to rest and catch breath.</p>

<p>Once or twice they jumped the new species of
deer, from sudden coverts; there were many large
birds, that rose with loud whirr. “Pheasants,” the
doctor and lieutenant called them. And twice, in
the early morning, they saw buffalo feeding—a
smaller buffalo than those upon the plains.</p>

<p>But they did not stop to hunt any of these.</p>

<p>About mid-morning they paused to rest again,
and gaze behind from an open rocky knoll. The sun
had burst forth.</p>

<p>“A fine day after all,” panted the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, up here. But look below. Ain’t that
a snowstorm, sir?” wheezed Terry Miller. The feet
of him and of John Brown, where seen through their
worn-out shoes, were bruised and bleeding. Stub’s
moccasins were shredded and soaked. The feet of
the lieutenant and the doctor were in no better shape.</p>

<p>Now when they gazed backward and down, they
looked upon a layer of dull cloud. With occasional
break, the cloud rested over all the country at the
mountain’s base—and through the breaks might be
seen the spume of falling snow!</p>

<p>“We’ve come some way, eh?” remarked the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
doctor. “Thank fortune, we’re above the storm.
We ought to be near the top.”</p>

<p>But peer as they might, they could not see the
top. The timber and the rocks extended on and on
and on.</p>

<p>“A pair o’ stockin’s would feel mighty good, on
this kind of a trip,” muttered John Brown. “’Tain’t
what you’d call a barefoot trail, in winter.”</p>

<p>They rested a minute, the men leaning upon
their muskets. Then——</p>

<p>“Come, boys,” the lieutenant urged impatiently.
“One more stint and we’ll make it. Forget your
feet. Think only of the top.”</p>

<p>They climbed, breathing short and fast while
they clambered and slipped. At noon they still had
not reached the top; several times the top seemed at
hand, but when they glimpsed it, shining white, it
always was across another ridge, and higher.</p>

<p>Stub’s ears rang, his heart drummed, his feet
weighed like lead. The two soldiers staggered and
stumbled. The snowstorm below appeared far. But
the lieutenant and the doctor knew no quitting.</p>

<p>“We’ll not reach it, this day,” gasped John
Brown. “’Tis the same old story. Marchin’, and
marchin’, and never gettin’ there.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, we’ll reach it to-morrow,” Terry
replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>The sun sank; the air grew very cold. Up here
there was nothing moving but themselves; the deer
and the pheasants and the squirrels had gone to bed.
The pines were soughing mournfully in an evening
breeze.</p>

<p>The lieutenant came to a stop before a reddish
cliff which overhung and formed a shallow cave.</p>

<p>“We’ve done enough for one day,” he panted.
Even he looked tired out. “I think we’ll gain the
top shortly in the morning. We’re into snow, and
the trees are thinning; the top cannot be far. We’ll
take advantage of this cave, for the night. It’s a
shelter, at least.”</p>

<p>“That’s one piece of luck,” the doctor laughed.</p>

<p>“We’ll bunk together, so as to keep warm,”
announced the lieutenant. “We’ll waive question
of rank—we’re all men, serving our Flag.”</p>

<p>He made no mention of the fact that they were
tired, hungry and thirsty after a long day’s climb,
and that they did not have blankets or food or water.
He seemed to think that if he could stand it, they
should stand it, too, for the sake of duty. That was
his style—that was one reason the men loved him.
He never asked them to do more than he did, and
he never took his ease even when he might, as
commander.</p>

<p>But this proved to be a miserable night. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
fire at the mouth of the cave smudged and smouldered.
The rock bed was hard and cold. There
was nothing to eat, nothing to drink, nothing to
see; all around stretched the slope of the mountain,
black and white and silent and lifeless—and cold,
cold, cold.</p>

<p>Nobody slept much, as they all lay huddled close
to each other for mutual warmth. They only dozed
shiveringly, afraid to move for fear of losing what
little warmth they were making.</p>

<p>It seemed to Stub that he had just dropped off,
at last, when he was aroused.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was standing outside the cave.
Daylight had come.</p>

<p>“Up, men,” the lieutenant cried. “See this
view! Oh, doctor! Be quick. It’s glorious.”</p>

<p>They piled out, with sundry grunts and groans
over muscles stiffened by yesterday’s work and by
the hard bed. The lieutenant had spoken truly. The
sky overhead was flushed rosily with sunrise—a clear
day, here; but the storm still raged down below.
The clouds there extended, level, in a thick layer
of drab and white and pink, closing off the plains
world from the mountain world.</p>

<p>“And yonder is the top, boys.” The lieutenant
pointed. “It’s nearer than we thought. Let’s try<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
for it now, and get back to camp and our supplies
before dark.”</p>

<p>He struck out and upward; in single file they
followed, trudging through the brittle snow, and
weaving among the pines. The final white ridge
which their eyes had been marking during most of
yesterday loomed large and plain above.</p>

<p>The snow gradually deepened. Its surface bore
not a trace of foot or paw or hoof. Soon it was to
their knees, soon thigh high; but they were out from
the trees and upon the bald space which formed
the top.</p>

<p>Only a few more steps, now, through snow waist
high, with rocks and gravel underfoot. Whew!
Now for it! Hooray! The lieutenant was there
first, to halt, and gaze about.</p>

<p>“Is that it, lieutenant?” puffed the doctor,
anxiously.</p>

<p>Terry Miller huskily cheered, stumbled, but
forged ahead.</p>

<p>The lieutenant stood, fixedly peering beyond.</p>

<p>“What!” uttered the doctor, arrived.</p>

<p>“<a href="#i_frontis">It’s the wrong peak, men</a>,” quietly said the
lieutenant, his voice flat in the thin air. “<a href="#i_frontis">Yes, the
wrong peak.</a>”</p>

<p>The others floundered to him and the doctor, to
gaze also. They all leaned heavily upon their guns.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Stub’s legs trembled; he had nothing upon which
to lean; but he stared, wide-eyed, his heart thumping.</p>

<p>It was the top. On the other side the mountain
fell away, in a long, long snowy timbered slope, down
into a deep, broad valley of dark pines; and at the
farther edge of the valley there arose a mountain
again—a snow-capped, much higher mountain: the
Grand Peak itself!<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[C]</a> They had climbed Cheyenne Mountain, height 9,407 feet,
south of Pike’s Peak, which is 14,109 feet in height.</p>

</div>

<p>“And all our climb’s for nothin’, you say, sir?”
wheezed John Brown. “We’re not on the Grand
Peak at all?”</p>

<p>“No. But our climb had not been for naught.
We’ve done our best, as soldiers.” The lieutenant’s
tone was dull and disappointed.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we made the mistake,” the doctor
proffered. “We thought that we were at the true
base.”</p>

<p>“We had no means of telling otherwise, doctor.
This mountain looked to be a part of that other;
but that other is separate, and twice as high. I judge
it’s fully fifteen miles distant, now.”</p>

<p>“Shall we try for it, sir?” Terry Miller asked.
“The day’s young, sir.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant shook his head decisively.</p>

<p>“Not this trip, Miller. ’Twould take a whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
day to reach its base. You and Brown have no
stockings, we none of us have proper clothing—no
blankets, no provisions, and there’s little prospect of
game. We’ve come so far, and taxed our strength
to the limit. Comparing the height of that mountain
with this, I believe that no human being can climb
the Grand Peak and survive. It is a region of eternal
snow, barred to all vestige of life. We’ll go back
while we can. We have performed our duty, and
we can see nothing from up here by reason of the
cloud bank.”</p>

<p>He looked at his thermometer.</p>

<p>“Four degrees below zero.” Zero was the freezing-point.</p>

<p>He glanced sharply about.</p>

<p>“We must make haste. The storm is rising
on us.”</p>

<p>And even as he spoke the air turned raw and
cloud wreaths began to float around them. So they
back-tracked as fast as they could, and guided by
a convenient ravine followed it down with such
speed that they reached their camp at the base before
dark, but in a snowstorm.</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed John Brown. “The horses are
safe, but the birds and beasts have eaten our deer
and everything else.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant shot a pheasant; of their meat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
there was left only two deer-ribs; and they drank
and ate.</p>

<p>“Rather limited rations, for five hungry persons
after a two-days’ fast,” the doctor joked.</p>

<p>“We have our blankets, and we are safe, sir,”
the lieutenant answered. “Such a matter as diet
should not enter into the calculations of men who
explore the wilderness. They must expect only
what they will get.”</p>

<p>“The little cap’n’s a man o’ iron; he’s not flesh
and blood,” Terry murmured, to John and Stub.
“But I reckon he’d not refuse a bit more rib,
himself.”</p>

<p>“With him, when your belt’s at the last hole,
why, cut another,” said John.</p>

<p>However, safe they were, although still very hungry.
In the morning they rode down the creek, constantly
getting lower and finding less snow. Just
after noon the men shot two buffalo. That made a
full feast—the first square meal in three days. So
to-night they camped more comfortably under some
shelving rock, outside the hills.</p>

<p>The place seemed to be a favorite camp ground
for Indians, also. The valley was strewn with their
horse sign, and with broken lodge-poles and old
lodge-pins. The lieutenant thought that these had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
been Ietan or Comanche camps, and was much
interested.</p>

<p>The next afternoon they sighted the stockade;
they were almost home.</p>

<p>“The flag’s still flying. Thank God, the party’s
all right,” exclaimed the lieutenant. “Give them a
cheer, boys, when we arrive. We return disappointed,
but not defeated, and far from conquered.”</p>

<p>The hoarse cheer was answered. The soldiers—Sergeant
Meek, Corporal Jerry Jackson, Freegift
Stout, Alex Roy, and all—trooped out, to stand in
line and present arms as the lieutenant, leading, rode
through the gate. He saluted them like an officer
again, and smiled wanly as if glad to be back.</p>

<small>ONWARD INTO WINTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“So yez didn’t climb the Grand Peak, after all,”
Tom Dougherty once more queried.</p>

<p>“We climbed far enough. As I told you before,
nothin’ on two legs or on twice two legs will ever
climb that Grand Peak,” John Brown answered.
“Only an eagle can fly there. We were above the
clouds, with naught to eat and little to breathe; and
yon was the Grand Peak itself, as high again.”</p>

<p>The men were wearied, but not yet wearied of
hearing about the try for the Grand Peak.</p>

<p>“You’re right. It’s beyond the reach o’ lungs
and legs,” said Sergeant Meek. “For the cap’n
and the doctor measured it to-day with their instruments,
from a good sight of it. Ten thousand, five
hundred and eighty-one feet above ground they make
it out to be, or a good two miles into the air. And
allowing for the fact that we’re nigh eight thousand
feet up, right where we be, though you might not
think it, that peak rises more’n eighteen thousand feet
above sea level. The cap’n says it’s close to being
the highest mountain in the world.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[D]</a> The Lieutenant’s measurement was wrong only about
1,000 feet. The height of the plain where they had been camping
was some 4,500 feet, and Pike’s Peak rises 9,600 feet above.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>Corporal Jerry Jackson came in, from changing
guard, and stood warming himself by the fire.</p>

<p>“By jiminy, those hosses are being eaten alive,”
he said. “I do pity ’em. I’d hate to be a hoss,
on a trip like this.”</p>

<p>“Yes; a man can understand an’ grin an’ bear
it; but a hoss hasn’t any sense o’ the why an’ wherefore.”</p>

<p>“Those pesky magpies are still at ’em, are they?”
asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>“A man to a hoss couldn’t keep the things off
with a club.”</p>

<p>“They even try to take the meat out a fellow’s
hands,” quoth Freegift Stout.</p>

<p>For the hungry magpies—bold birds of black-and-white,
with long tails—hovered over the unsaddled
and unpacked horses, lighted and pecked
their raw backs until the blood flowed afresh. The
horses, poor weak, thin creatures, kicked and whinneyed
in vain. The magpies stuck fast and rode
upon them, pecking. And as Freegift declared,
swooped at the men also and grabbed for the meat
in their hands.</p>

<p>“Have Roy and Gordon come in sight yet?”
Sergeant Meek asked.</p>

<p>“We thought we could see ’em away out,” replied
Corporal Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t wish ’em frozen feet. We’ve got
enough of such in camp.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and one pair too many, speaking for myself,”
groaned Jake Carter.</p>

<p>This was the fourth day since leaving the stockade,
and a bitter cold day, albeit warmer, according
to the lieutenant’s instrument, than yesterday. The
thermometer stood at only three degrees below
freezing; yesterday it had been at seventeen below.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had marched them out of the
stockade, in a heavy snowstorm, on the morning
after the return from the climb. The route was
westward, again, up the south side of the Arkansaw.
Just why he was so impatient to go on, snow or
no snow, none of the men knew. Maybe he was in
hopes of finding the Ietans or Comanches, yet; but
Stub himself was quite certain that the Ietans wintered
farther south. Or if he wished to discover
the head of the Arkansaw and of the Red River,
then the men wondered why he didn’t build warm
quarters, and lay in meat, and make fur clothing,
so as to explore safely.</p>

<p>“Sure, sometimes I think that what he’s aimin’
at is to foller this here Spanish trail cl’ar into New
Mexico, an’ fetch up, with all of us, at Santy Fe,
even as prisoners to them Spanish,” John Sparks
hazarded. “We can swear we made a mistake,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
not knowin’ the country; an’ when we get back home
again we’ll have a nice lot o’ news about them people
an’ the trail in, for the Government.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do,” Sergeant Meek rebuked. “’Tis for
him to lead and for us to follow; and he’ll do the
thinking.”</p>

<p>They had marched fifteen miles, the first day,
through the storm, with all on foot because the
horses were getting unable to carry anything but
the packs. In fact, for some days past it had been
more comfortable to walk than to ride.</p>

<p>All that night it had snowed, and was still snowing
in the morning. The men had slept under one
blanket or robe apiece, in the snow. The little tent
for the lieutenant and the doctor and Stub sagged
with the weight.</p>

<p>“My gracious, but this is hard on the horses,”
Baroney said. “They paw and paw, to find one
mouthful—and on their backs the ravens take many
mouthfuls.”</p>

<p>This day there was no marching. The men had
all they could do to keep the fires going, and not
freeze. John Sparks, who was a hunter, went out,
but saw nothing. By evening the snow was a foot
deep on the level—pretty tough for bare feet exposed
in gaping shoes, and even for damp moccasins.</p>

<p>During the bitter night the sky cleared. It was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
be the seventeen-below morning. On the march one
old buffalo bull was sighted, across the river. John
Sparks and Hugh Menaugh mounted and went after
him. They had to swim their horses through the
ice-covered current, but they got the bull. Then,
only two miles farther, everybody was ordered to
cross, because a steep ridge barred the way.</p>

<p>In wading and breaking the ice, all were drenched
waist high, and their wet clothing froze instantly.
The lieutenant was wearing only thin cotton overalls,
like most of the men, but he seemed not to feel the
cold. He sent back help for John and Hugh, and
set the other men at work building a fire. When
John and Hugh arrived, with the meat, their feet had
been frozen and they had to be lifted from their
horses.</p>

<p>After they had been thawed out by snow and
rubbing, and clothes had been partially dried, the
march was continued, over a very rough, hilly country,
up the north side of the swiftly flowing river.
Then one of the pack-horses, driven crazy by the
magpies and by hunger, ran off, back down the trail.</p>

<p>Jake Carter, Terry Miller and Pat Smith had
pursued him on foot. By dusk, when camp was
made at the end of thirteen miles, they were not
in sight. The lieutenant grew worried.</p>

<p>“It’s foolhardy for them to try to stay out all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
night, with no food or blankets,” he said; and the
doctor nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“They’re likely to perish, on that open prairie,”
he agreed. “But what’s to be done? To search for
them would be a fruitless risk, lieutenant.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant sat up late, waiting for word from
them. This morning they had appeared, Jake Carter
with his feet, also, frozen. It had been a terrible
night, for them. They had found the horse, but
could not bring him in.</p>

<p>So the lieutenant had directed Alex Roy and
William Gordon to ride and get the horse (which
was almost frozen, itself, the other men had reported);
and he and the doctor, with Stub and
John Sparks, went out to scout. The lieutenant and
the doctor measured the height of the Grand Peak,
from a distance; they and John killed two buffalo-bulls,
for moccasins for the camp, and took after a
cow but didn’t get it.</p>

<p>The gritty John Sparks stayed, to kill a cow if
he might; the other three returned to camp with the
bull hides.</p>

<p>Now the men, with numbed fingers, were busy
making moccasins, around the fire, and not envying
John the buffalo-hunter.</p>

<p>Alex Roy and Bill Gordon came in, with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
strayed horse in tow, but at dusk John had not
appeared.</p>

<p>“He’s still after his cow, and won’t quit till he
fetches meat. That’s him! Well, he has a buffalo-robe
and his flint and steel, so we’ll see him in the
morning.”</p>

<p>They didn’t worry about John. He was a good
hunter and could take care of himself.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had decided not to wait for him,
but to pick him up on the way. The next morning,
which was the fifth morning, he broke camp at five
o’clock, long before daylight; and sure enough, before
they had marched far they found John. He
rode in on them, with a load of cow meat. To-day
they marched twenty miles, afoot and ahorse; killed
two more buffalo and six wild turkeys; and what with
the new moccasins and plenty of meat they thought
themselves well fixed.</p>

<p>The country steadily grew rougher and the march
led higher, but the soil was gravelly and the snow less
than below. Pretty soon the Spanish trail was lost
again. From camp everybody went out, searching
for it, on both sides of the river.</p>

<p>“Come along wid us, lad,” invited Tom
Dougherty, of Stub; and afoot Stub ascended the
south side of the river with Tom, and John Sparks,
and John Mountjoy. It was a good squad. Tom was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
scarcely more than a boy, himself: a young warrior
of twenty years.</p>

<p>Presently they struck a broad horse-trail, pointing
up-river.</p>

<p>“We’ll see where it goes to,” said John Sparks.
They followed it as rapidly as they could. The river
flowed down shallow and rippling and ice-bordered,
among reddish, bare, rounded hills sprinkled with
cedar and with snow patches. Far northward they
saw, every now and then, the glistening Grand Peak.
It was hard to lose this Grand Peak.</p>

<p>About noon they emerged from the long valley
of the river into a broadening, with snow peaks
shimmering in the distances, and a line of high flat-topped
hills crossing the route before.</p>

<p>“Hist! There be Injuns or them Spanish,
likely!” Tom warned, pointing ahead.</p>

<p>They halted and peered.</p>

<p>“No. I take it they’re some of our own men,”
said John Mountjoy.</p>

<p>“What do ye say, Stub?” John Sparks queried.</p>

<p>Stub nodded. His eyes were true eyes.</p>

<p>“No Injuns. Our men,” he asserted.</p>

<p>So they went on, toward the flat-topped hills,
and met the parties of Sergeant Meek and Baroney.</p>

<p>“Hello to you,” John Sparks greeted “What
luck?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“There’s no good your going much further up
this side,” answered Sergeant Meek. “The trail
ends, and you’ll get nowhere.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You see where those flat-tops lie? The river
comes out the mountains there, and comes a-whooping.
We followed it up, till the valley got narrower
and narrower; and right soon the river was nothing
but a brook in width, boiling out something tremendous
from betwixt cliffs half a mile high, leaving
no space for man or beast. Nothing gets through
there, except the water. We’re thinking the trail
must cross the river this side the gap, and turn off
north’ard to round it.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[E]</a> They had met near where present Canyon City, Colorado,
is located, on the Upper Arkansas River at the mouth of the
famous Grand Canyon of the Arkansas. The gap between the
cliffs was the Royal Gorge, in the Canyon.</p>

</div>

<p>“Yes, it doesn’t tackle that gap, anyhow,” the
men all declared.</p>

<p>“Suppose we might as well ford at a good spot,
an’ scout about a bit,” proffered John Sparks.</p>

<p>So ford they all did, wading and splashing
through, and slipping on the rounded stones of
the bottom. The trail was found indeed, farther
up, on the north side, where it left the river and
bore northwestward through a dry valley or bottom,
as if seeking a pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>“Now, whether to call this the trail o’ the
Spaniards, ag’in, or an Injun trail, I dunno,” mused
John Sparks, as they all grouped, examining.</p>

<p>“It’s a hoss trail, plain enough,” uttered Bill
Gordon.</p>

<p>“’Tis hard to read, that’s a fact,” Sergeant Meek
said. “But it leads somewheres, and like as not to
the Red River that the cap’n’s looking for, in
Comanche country. Anyhow, we’ve done all we can,
for to-day; and it’s time we went back down and
reported.”</p>

<p>“Sure, he’ll have no excuse for takin’ us through
betwixt them high cliffs,” declared Alex Roy.
“We’d be drowneded, hosses an’ all. ’Tis a tough-lookin’
hole, with no end in sight, an’ the rocks
covered with ice.”</p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” bade the sergeant, “or we’ll
be late for supper.”</p>

<p>They turned and marched back, down river, to
camp. This evening the lieutenant talked the report
over with the doctor. They decided to proceed up
the river, to the dry valley, and follow the trail.</p>

<p>The dry valley, below where the river gushed out
of the break in the cliff barrier, was reached in one
day’s march. Camp was made in it at night-fall.
This, according to the doctor, was the evening of
the tenth day of December. The horses were watered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
with melted snow, and given one pint of precious
corn, each, brought this far from the Osage and the
Republican Pawnee towns. For the camp there was
plenty of deer meat, killed on the way, and one buffalo.
It was to be the last big meal, through some
days.</p>

<p>The Spanish trail had been weak, upon entering
the valley. The lieutenant had rather feared that the
sign was only that of a small scouting party. But
farther in it had strengthened. Now at the camp it
appeared to be a fairly well-trodden road, leading
on northwest and probably over the next range of
hills.</p>

<p>“The road to the Red River—hooray!” cheered
Tom Dougherty. “Then down the Red River we’ll
go, out o’ this cruel cowld, an’ belike we’ll be to
Natchitoches an’ the blessed war-rmth o’ Louisiany
long before spring.”</p>

<small>SEEKING THE LOST RIVER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“It’s no use to march farther on this line,
doctor.”</p>

<p>Doctor Robinson answered promptly.</p>

<p>“I think you’re right, lieutenant. We’re getting
nowhere, only deeper into the mountains. Men and
horses are about at the end of their strength. There
seems to be nothing ahead, except more cold, hunger
and blind scrambling.”</p>

<p>“The men are brave fellows,” said the lieutenant.
“That human beings, half fed and near naked,
should be called upon to endure such marches and
camps, amidst snow and zero weather, is almost more
than can be expected from even soldiers. Their pay
is a pittance, they don’t know where they’re going,
they were not prepared for winter, yet I’ve heard not
a word of complaint. When we return to the United
States, the Government surely will reward them.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor, with Stub, were
standing upon a high ridge some distance from
camp. A week had passed since they all had entered
the dry valley, to follow the trail north from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Arkansaw, on the search for the head of the Red
River.</p>

<p>But instead of rounding the gap in the cliffs,
the trail had led away, and away, ever northward,
into the midst of the snow-caps. Presently, or after
a couple of days, it had come out at the bank of
another river, frozen over, forty paces wide, and
flowing, as the lieutenant discovered, <em>northeast</em>!</p>

<p>That was a disappointment and a surprise. He
and the doctor plainly were puzzled. The river was
wrong. To be the Red River it should have flowed
southeast. The lieutenant decided that this river
must be the Platte River—or the beginnings of it,
for the great Platte River was known to flow mainly
through the plains, far north of the Pawnee country,
and hundreds of miles distant.</p>

<p>The snowy mountains had closed around. They
rose high and white and coldly silent. There appeared
to be no way out, except by the back trail to
the Arkansaw again, or by following this new river
down-stream, but where?<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[F]</a> If this stream was the South Platte River, as the Lieutenant
thought, then they had entered into the western part of
Central Colorado’s great South Park; very far indeed from
any Red River.</p>

</div>

<p>The trail was continuing, up along this frozen
river that wound through a series of snowy valleys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
between steep wooded hills. They all marched upon
it. It evidently was going somewhere, perhaps to a
better country, perhaps still to the head of the Red
River and the circuit south for the lower regions of
New Mexico. At least, the Spanish had some goal
in view.</p>

<p>Next, they had come to a large camp, the largest
yet, and only a few weeks old. But it had been
an Indian camp. There were the circles where lodges—many
lodges—had stood, the ashes in the center of
each, and sign of fully one thousand horses.</p>

<p>“Utah,” declared Baroney, examining a cast-off
moccasin.</p>

<p>Stub agreed. Moccasins differed, and these were
Utah moccasins, by the cut.</p>

<p>“Sure, then we’re not follerin’ the Spanish, or
even the Comanches,” John Sparks groaned, doubled
over with rheumatism. The men all were pretty
badly crippled by frost and chilblains and rheumatism,
and their belts were small around their stomachs.
“Weren’t ye ever in this country before,
boy? The Utahs had ye, once, you say.”</p>

<p>Stub did not know.</p>

<p>“No remember. Big country, John. Mebbe
here, mebbe somewhere.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor had asked him the
same question; but he was as puzzled as they. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
might have been hereabouts in summer; it was very
different in winter. His head hurt, too. So he
could not help them.</p>

<p>From the old camp, which seemed to have been
a hunting camp, a regular village, and extended six
miles long and two miles wide, covering the valley
bottom, a trail led out, up stream again. In killing
two buffalo (the first fresh meat since leaving the
Arkansaw) another gun had burst—the third in the
march. Its muzzle had got stopped with snow, and
its barrel was very brittle from the frost.</p>

<p>John Sparks cut the burst end off, so that the
gun might be used. Hugh Menaugh had no gun at
all, and was marching with the lieutenant’s sword
and pistols.</p>

<p>The trail westward was not made by the Spanish.
The Spanish trail (if there had been any
Spanish trail) was swallowed up, in the big camp.
But the trail out was better than none at all. It led
through still more old camping places, where there
were empty corn-cribs. There were no old cornfields,
though, and this set the men to wondering
whether these Indians might not have got corn from
the Spaniards, after all.</p>

<p>Then, on a sudden, the trail quit. It left them
stranded, amidst the mountains. That had occurred
this morning. The lieutenant had sent out searching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
parties. He then had taken the doctor and Stub,
and climbed to the top of the high ridge, to spy out
the country lying around.</p>

<p>“The men should be rewarded the same as the
Lewis and Clark men will be rewarded—with money
and land,” now the doctor said.</p>

<p>“A more heroic little band never wore the United
States uniform,” the lieutenant declared.</p>

<p>The doctor laughed.</p>

<p>“They’re not wearing that, these days, lieutenant.
No one would take you and them for soldiers.”</p>

<p>Very true. About the last trace of the blue uniforms
had vanished. Only the lieutenant still had
blue trousers, of thin cloth, for wearing on the
march. His chief’s uniform, of bright shoulder-pieces
and shining buttons, he kept in a trunk, until
he should meet the Spaniards or the Comanches.
From his red-lined cloak he had cut a cap, and sewed
fox-skin to it, for the inside; the rest of the cloak
had gone into socks and mittens, for himself and
Stub. On his feet were buffalo-hide moccasins, on
his body a capote or blanket-coat; and up to his
knees his legs were wrapped in deer-hide. He looked
like a chief, nevertheless.</p>

<p>All this was little enough, for day and night
wear in cold and storm. The doctor had less. To
be sure, he had made himself a fur cap, of rabbit-skin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
and a deer-hide coat and mittens—but buckskin,
without much under it, is cold stuff, as everybody
knows. His trousers were torn so that they
showed his own skin. His feet were clad in socks
cut from a piece of blanket, and in the hide moccasins
which did not fit and had to be tied on with thongs.</p>

<p>The men, and Stub, had been put to all kinds of
shifts. Some wore coats cut, like the doctor’s socks,
from the gray, threadbare army blankets—and socks
to match. Some wore coats of leather—poorly
tanned hides that they had saved. Some wore even
leather trousers like leggins. All wore buffalo hide
moccasins, but not a one had a hat or cap. Their
long hair protected their heads, and their faces were
covered with shaggy, bristling beards—except Tom
Dougherty, whose beard was only a stubble in
patches. The other men poked a great deal of fun
at young Tom.</p>

<p>As for Stub, his beautiful robe had long ago been
turned into moccasins and leggins; and he tried to
be comfortable in these, and a shirt from a left-over
piece of John Sparks’ gray blanket, and socks and
mittens from the lieutenant’s red-lined cloak. He
did not need a cap.</p>

<p>Of course, the blankets and hides that had been
used were needed for coverings, at night; but in
such cold weather it was almost impossible to strip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
other hides and dress them. They were like boards,
especially the buffalo hides. And deer were scarce.</p>

<p>From the high ridge where he and the lieutenant
and the doctor stood the view was wide and wonderful,
although not cheering. Mountains, mountains,
mountains, their sides and tips shining white with
snow, their bases, where seen, dark with wooded
hills, the pine branches heavily laden by winter.</p>

<p>Far in the east and the southeast the mountains
seemed to form a line with every gap stopped.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that our Grand Peak, away yonder?”
asked the doctor, pointing. “If so, I judge it’s a
hundred miles, as the bird flies.”</p>

<p>“And unreachable from here, except by a bird,
sir. We’re shut off from it, completely. Besides,
our road does not lie in that direction. Our duty
as explorers demand that we do not give up so
easily.” And the lieutenant turned his glasses, so
as to sweep the north and the northwest.</p>

<p>On the north were lofty hills, pine covered,
breaking the nearer view; and snow mountains
grouped behind them. The frozen river, marked by
willows, stretched onward, in crooked bed, through
the valley, now broad, now narrowed, into the northwest,
soon to be closed upon by the hills and mountains
there.</p>

<p>In all the great expanse nothing moved; even the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
other exploring parties were out of sight. It was a
dead country.</p>

<p>The lieutenant shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Not very promising, eh?” the doctor queried
anxiously.</p>

<p>“It does not promise success. Our course up
this river should be abandoned. We are constantly
making farther and farther northward, separated
from the Red River by the mountains; game is getting
less, the trail is unreliable, and we shall depend
upon it no longer.”</p>

<p>He gazed southward. The hills rose to mountains
here also. He used his spy-glass intently. He
handed it to the doctor.</p>

<p>“You’ll see a great white mountain range, appearing
through a gap almost directly south.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. A thundering way off.”</p>

<p>“It seems to be the end of a long chain extending
westward from it. That chain, I believe, is the
divide draining on this side into the Platte, on the
other side into the Red River. We’re on the wrong
side. We should march southwest, to cross the
nearer portion of the chain, and eventually come out
upon the head of the Red River. At all events, we’ll
try it, while we can. But our march through here
has not been wasted, for our Country. We can lay
down on our map the sources of the Platte, which no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
one has supposed to be located at such a distance from
the plains.”</p>

<p>They all took another look, scanning the region
south and southwest. With his own eyes Stub might
descry the landmark of the Great White Mountains.
The air was very clear, the sun rested just right,
and through the gap there the tops of the mountains,
sharp cut and triangular, stood out plainly amidst the
other, lesser peaks. That called for a long, long
journey.</p>

<p>They went back to camp. The other parties
came in, and reported nothing but an old Indian
camp, farther up. They had seen no game.</p>

<p>“An’ what nixt, then, I wonder?” Pat Smith
remarked, at the fire. “Do we kape goin’, wid no
end. Sure, the Red River can’t lay hereabouts.
We’ll be nearer comin’ to Canady.”</p>

<p>“No keep going,” Stub proudly announced.
“The cap’n say turn ’round, for south. Big ridge
there; big white mountains; Red River other side.”</p>

<p>“South’ard? Hooray! That’s a good word.
It puts heart into us; hey, lads? We’ll be gettin’
out o’ this trap where even the Injuns don’t dare
bide in winter, an’ we’ll be findin’ the Red River,
after all.”</p>

<p>Stub’s news cheered the men greatly. It took
only a little to encourage them.</p>

<small>IS IT FOUND AT LAST?</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“The Red River, men! Three cheers! We
think we’ve found it at last!”</p>

<p>It was the evening of the second day’s march
into the southwest. The doctor and the lieutenant
had gone out from camp, to survey about, as usual.
The first line of mountains had been crossed and
already every eye was eager and every heart was
keen for the traces of the shifty Red River.</p>

<p>Matters looked promising, too. Noon camp to-day
had been made at a little spring, the unfrozen
waters of which flowed trickling and formed a small
stream wending southeast for the bottom of the
valley.</p>

<p>“The beginnings of the Red River—do you
reckon it might be the beginnings of the Red River,
cap’n?” the men queried.</p>

<p>But the lieutenant smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t dare say so, lads, and disappoint
you. We may be a long way yet from the real Red
River.”</p>

<p>Still, some of the men did not believe him, until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
they had left the valley and the spring behind, and
in a narrow pass of the next ridge had come upon
another spring and another stream, larger. Among
so many springs and streams, who might tell which
was the source of the Red River?</p>

<p>They followed the stream part way through the
pass, and encamped there in a snowstorm. The
snow, sifting thickly, shut off the view before; it was
glum weather for a hungry camp; the men crouched
close, snow-covered, around the fire, or moved hobbling,
at their various jobs; the gaunt, sore-backed
horses cropped desperately, pawing into the snow,
or hunched, coughing and groaning, in the scant
shelter of the low cedars and spruces.</p>

<p>The horses of the lieutenant and the doctor, and
Stub’s yellow pony, had been turned into pack animals,
to lessen the loads of the other animals.
Everybody was marching on foot.</p>

<p>“Did you say that the cap’n an’ the doctor
thought likely we’d have to go cl’ar back south’ard,
fur as the Great White Mountains yonder, so’s to
strike the river?” John Sparks asked, of Stub.</p>

<p>“Mebbe there, mebbe sooner,” Stub nodded.</p>

<p>“If we ketch ’em, I hope he won’t be axin’ us
to climb ’em,” spoke John Brown.</p>

<p>“Got to ketch ’em, first,” laughed somebody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“We might as well be chasing a mountain as a
river,” said Terry Miller.</p>

<p>“Oui,” agreed Baroney. “Ma foi, the mountains
are there, in sight; but the river—it’s nowhere.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, never mind, lads,” Sergeant Meek
put in. “Not a man of us works as hard as him and
the doctor; they’re always breaking the trail, and
they’re always out whilst we’re resting a bit. Look
at ’em now, scouting in the snow without a bite to
eat. Sure, we ought to be proud to keep a stiff
upper lip and follow ’em as fur as they’ll go, whether
that’s to Canady or Mexico or the Pacific Ocean.
Ain’t we soldiers?”</p>

<p>“We’ll follow. You bet we will,” the men
chorused. “There’s no harm meant in our talk,
but we got to talk about somethin’ besides our feet
an’ our bellies.”</p>

<p>Now here came the lieutenant and the doctor—trudging
fast, panting, snowy, their beards plastered
white, but their thin faces lighted with smiles. The
doctor gleefully flourished his fur cap, and hailed
them.</p>

<p>“The Red River, men! Three cheers! We think
we’ve found it at last!”</p>

<p>“Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!” The steep
sides of the narrow pass echoed, and the miserable
horses half pricked their ears, dumbly questioning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>The two came directly to the fire. They were
out of breath. The circle respectfully opened for
them.</p>

<p>“Did we hear right? Is it true, then, sir? Ye
found the Red River?” eagerly inquired Sergeant
Meek, of the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Yes, sergeant.” And the lieutenant beat his
red cap and stamped, to dislodge some of his snow.
“That is, the signs are the most hopeful for many
a day, and we all have good reason to be inspired
of success. Listen, men. The facts are these: Doctor
Robinson and I advanced about four miles, out
of this defile and into a prairie that lies beyond.
There we discovered a fine stream, with all the characteristics
of a river. It is some twenty-five yards
wide, very swift, in a clearly marked rocky channel,
and the general direction of its flow is southeast.”</p>

<p>“Hooray!”</p>

<p>“The creek we are now encamped beside evidently
joins it. This is all I have to say at present.
To-morrow, or as soon as marching conditions warrant,
we will proceed, examine the ground more thoroughly,
and demonstrate whether or not we may
consider ourselves actually at the source of the Red
River.”</p>

<p>“News like that takes the chill off the air,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
laughed Freegift Stout, when the lieutenant and the
doctor had gone into their tent, for a rubdown.</p>

<p>“B’gorry, we been tellin’ ’em that the Red River
was surely hereabouts,” asserted Tom Dougherty.
“Wan spring, an’ then another, an’ then a crick, an’
then the river itself—an’ nixt, out o’ the mountains
we’ll be an’ wid iv’ry mile gettin’ closer to war-rmth
an’ people.”</p>

<p>“What do you want o’ people?” Corporal Jerry
demanded. “They may be the Spanish, or the Pawnees
again, or worse.”</p>

<p>“Come wan, come all,” Tom retorted. “Sure,
I wouldn’t object to a bit of a fight, for a change,
man to man. But fightin’ these mountains is up-hill
work.” And he laughed at his joke.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope with all my heart the cap’n’s
struck the right trail,” said Sergeant Meek. “And
he’s pretty certain, or he wouldn’t have said so much.
He’s no man to make a brag, as you know. For the
first time since we entered the mountains he’s looking
sort o’ content. He deserves a turn o’ luck. ’Tis
always of his country he’s thinking, and of us, and
never of himself; and though in matter of muscle he’s
the smallest man amongst us, he picks the hardest
jobs.”</p>

<p>In the morning the snow was falling faster than
ever. They all were anxious to reach the river, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
the pass was so clogged with drifts and their horses
were so weak that the march took them only out to
the edge of the bottom-land.</p>

<p>It was the fifth day without sight of game. The
lieutenant ordered a hunt, before dark; but not even
a rabbit was found. There was nothing but snow,
snow, snow.</p>

<p>“My belt’s twice around me already, an’ is
startin’ on the third lap,” declared Alex Roy.</p>

<p>However, the horses were in luck, at last—and
they needed it. John Sparks and Tom Dougherty
reported a fine big patch of long grass down near
the river. In the morning the lieutenant sent
Baroney and Stub, with the wretched animals, to
set them to grazing and herd them—and a long cold
task this proved to be.</p>

<p>Still, as Baroney said, as he and Stub trudged
about or squatted with their backs to the squalls:</p>

<p>“If we cannot eat, ourselves, it is a great pleasure
to watch the horses eat; hein?”</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Corporal Jerry Jackson
came down.</p>

<p>“You’re to fetch the horses in with you, at dusk,”
he said. “Never a trace of game, all day, so we’ll
pull out in the mornin’.”</p>

<p>“Down the Red River, mebbe, Jerry?” Stub
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>“I dunno, but somewhere. The cap’n knows—an’
he knows we’re on short rations of only a few
mouthfuls to a man.”</p>

<p>The doctor and Baroney were to start out early,
down river, hunting. The lieutenant and two or
three men were to explore up stream and see where
the river began, if they could. The rest of the men
were to march down river with the baggage, until
they killed enough game so that they might camp
and wait.</p>

<p>“Miller and Mountjoy, ’tis you with the cap’n,”
ordered Sergeant Meek.</p>

<p>“I go, too, Bill?” pleaded Stub.</p>

<p>“Sure, that’s for him to say. I’ve only my
orders, lad,” Sergeant Bill answered.</p>

<p>So Stub appealed to Lieutenant Pike himself.</p>

<p>“I go with you, please?”</p>

<p>But the lieutenant gravely shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not this time, my boy. You’d best go down
river with the others, where there’s more chance of
finding game. Up stream it’s a rough country, and
the three of us are likely to be hard put for meat.
We’ll only explore for a day or two; you stay with
the party.”</p>

<p>As anybody might have foretold, the lieutenant
again had taken the heaviest work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>“I go with the doctor, then, please,” Stub proposed.
“Down river.”</p>

<p>“He and Baroney will be hunting. You have
no weapon. But you can do your duty like a soldier
by tending the horses.”</p>

<p>Stub mournfully thought upon his bow, broken
several days ago. Hugh Menaugh spoke up, saluting.</p>

<p>“Beggin’ your pardon, cap’n—he’s a plucky lad
an’ if you say for him to go wid the doctor he can
have one o’ the pistols you loaned to me. Belike he’ll
fare as well wid the doctor as wid us, an’ mebbe
bring him luck. An’ we’ve all been boys, ourselves,
oneasy for doin’ things.”</p>

<p>“You’ve a kind heart, my man,” answered the
lieutenant, smiling. “If the doctor is agreeable to
having his company, all right. You may settle it
between you.”</p>

<p>Settled it was, right speedily, for Doctor Robinson
had a kind heart, too.</p>

<p>“Here’s your pistol, then,” Hugh bade. “Wid
wan load. Be sure ye get a buff’lo, now.”</p>

<p>Stub nodded, and carefully stowed the long dragoon
pistol in under his belt. The curved handle
crossed his stomach.</p>

<p>“I see him, I get him, Hugh.”</p>

<p>He and the doctor and Baroney set out, first.</p>

<p>“Down river; we’ll meet you down the Red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
River, Baroney, old hoss,” called the men. “Here’s
wishin’ you fat meat, doctor, sir—an’ the same for
the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll follow the main trail in two days and catch
up,” the lieutenant had promised. “But nobody
is to wait for me until meat has been secured. Do
your best, doctor. There are rations for only forty-eight
hours.”</p>

<p>It was another lean day. Although the three
did do their best, scouting in advance from the river
to the hills, and exploring the side draws, oftentimes
waist deep in the snow, they stirred never a hoof nor
paw, and rarely a feather. That was discouraging.</p>

<p>Now and again they saw the main party, who had
crossed the river and were toiling along, down the
other flank of its winding course.</p>

<p>“Not a thing sighted by us, and not a gunshot
heard from those other fellows,” the doctor sighed,
at evening. “Well, we’d better go over and join
them, for camp, and try again in the morning.”</p>

<p>They made for the fire that was twinkling, below
and beyond; crossed the river upon the ice, and
arrived.</p>

<p>“Any luck, sir?” queried Sergeant Meek, of
the doctor.</p>

<p>“None to-day sergeant; but we have hopes for
to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The same here, sir.”</p>

<p>“So ye didn’t fetch in a buffler with that big
pistol?” John Sparks bantered, of Stub.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” answered weary Stub.</p>

<p>“To-morrow is a grand time,” said Baroney.
“If there wasn’t any to-morrow, I don’t know what
we’d do.”</p>

<p>The supper to-night was a scant meal, for all:
just a few mouthfuls of dried meat and a handful
of parched corn. In the morning the doctor decided
briskly.</p>

<p>“You’ve rations for only to-day, sergeant?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and scarce that, but we can make ’em
do.”</p>

<p>“I feel sure that Baroney and the boy and I
will find game before night. If we do, we’ll come
in with it. But you keep on, as Lieutenant Pike
ordered, until you kill meat or until he joins you,
and never mind our whereabouts. We’ll take care of
ourselves somehow, and I don’t propose to come in
unless loaded.”</p>

<p>“You’ll likely stay out, in the hills, sir, you
mean?”</p>

<p>“That depends on the day’s luck,” smiled the
doctor. “But even if we do, we’ll be no worse
off than Lieutenant Pike and Miller and Mountjoy.
We’re all rationed the same, and there’s little to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
choose between camping together and camping
separately.”</p>

<p>But even Stub felt the seriousness of it when
again he followed the doctor and Baroney, for the
second day’s hunt. If nothing was killed to-day,
then to-morrow they would begin to starve; pretty
soon they would be eating the horses, and next their
moccasins, and without horses and moccasins they
would die before getting out of the mountains.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIII">XIII<br />
<small>MEAT FOR THE CAMP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Buffalo!</p>

<p>Stub stared hard. He scarcely could believe his
bleared, aching eyes. Was it really true? Buffalo?
Now what to do?</p>

<p>This was early in the third morning after leaving
the main camp. For two days he and the doctor
and Baroney had been hunting, hunting, from dawn
to dark; ranging up and down, among the hills and
draws, and wading the snow, on only one small meal.
In fact, they practically had had nothing at all to
eat, in forty-eight hours. Through the two nights
they had tended fire and shiveringly dozed, without
blankets, in the best spot they might find, where they
could secure a little protection from the biting wind.</p>

<p>How they were going to keep on living if they
discovered nothing to eat, this day, he did not know;
Baroney did not know; the doctor hadn’t said. But
they had told the sergeant not to expect them unless
with good news; the other men probably were famishing,
too, and they themselves might as well starve
in one place as another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>Full of aches and pains (and that was all!) they
had passed a bad night, so that this morning they
really had been glad to stagger up and out again, into
the bleak whity-gray, even though they might be
starting upon only another long day of fruitless
tramping.</p>

<p>Baroney groaned.</p>

<p>“Ma foi! My legs move, my head thinks, but
there is nothing between. I have no stomach.”</p>

<p>“We’ll find meat to-day. Not only for ourselves
but for the boys in camp, remember,” encouraged
the doctor. “They’re likely depending on us, for
we’ve heard no gunshots. We must separate and
hunt widely.”</p>

<p>They had trudged forth, before sun-up. They
had crossed the first wooded ridge, to the next little
valley.</p>

<p>“Stub, you follow up, along the high ground
on this side,” the doctor ordered. “Baroney will
take the middle. I’ll take the farther side. Move
slowly and all together, and we’ll surely start something.
Head off anything that comes your way,
Stub, and drive it down to us. Don’t waste the load
in your pistol.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will drive,” answered Stub, patiently.</p>

<p>He waited, shivering, until Baroney had halted
in the bottom, and the doctor had toiled clear across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
to the other slope, and up. Then they three moved
on together—one searching either flank, the third
in between.</p>

<p>The valley was not wide. Its bottom was level
and open except for the snow-covered brush; its sides
were dotted with cedars and pines. Keeping near
the top of his side, so as to drive anything down hill,
Stub hunted faithfully, hoping, too, that he would
hear the doctor or Baroney shoot. His eyes scanned
every foot before and to right and left, seeking
tracks. Even a rabbit would be welcomed—yet he
didn’t wish to spend his bullet on a rabbit.</p>

<p>He saw nothing to make him draw his pistol. It
weighed heavily and rasped his stomach and thigh
as he plodded on.</p>

<p>The sun was about to rise above the snowy ridges
on the east. They had been hunting for an hour,
at least, and had heard never a sound. Then he
reached a place where his slope broke sharply into
a side valley. A fellow always expected something,
at such places. So he stole forward cautiously; he
came to a ledge of rock, and peered down. What
he saw instantly almost stopped his heart-beating,
and dazed his eyes with sudden excitement.</p>

<p>Buffalo! Really? Yes, yes—buffalo! He was
not dreaming.</p>

<p>It was more of a basin than a valley, in there:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
broadening to a snug cup protected by rim-rock,
just back of the opening into the main valley, and
thence tapering and climbing until it pinched out,
on the ridge. A few leafless aspens (sign of water)
and sprawly evergreens grew in the cup, and there
was marsh grass, in weedy clumps. And the
buffalo.</p>

<p>Two—three, lying down and comfortable, like
cattle, their legs under them. The snow was well
trodden; they had been in here some time.</p>

<p>Now what to do? He trembled, and thought
his best. If he only might take the time to signal
Baroney and the doctor. But even as he peered
the sun flashed up, and the first beams streamed
into the cup. One large bull suddenly stirred, and
all at once was on his feet, swaying his shaggy
head and sniffing the air. Was it the sun, or did
the breeze tell him something? He may have scented
the doctor, or Baroney, or Stub, or he might merely
be thinking of breakfast and the day’s program.</p>

<p>There! The second buffalo was out of bed, and
imitating the first. The third seemed to be getting
uneasy. Stub dared not delay, to signal. His eyes
roved rapidly. He was too far, for pistol shooting.
The buffalo might only start to graze—they might
start to travel, warned by danger smell—and they
were as likely to go one way as another. He must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
get down in behind them and drive them out where
the doctor and Baroney would see them.</p>

<p>He drew back, and crouching scurried on a half
circuit, to slip into the basin, above them. He struck
a little ravine, leading down. All his practice at
scouting with the Pawnee boys stood him in good
stead, now. He moved fast but silently, darting
from spot to spot, stepping with care and listening
for alarm sounds; and stealing more gently as he
arrived at the bottom, where the ravine ended in a
cedar and a shoulder of rock.</p>

<p>The upper edge of the basin was just around
that corner. He planned to step out, into sight. The
buffalo would run in the other direction, and the
doctor or Baroney might be able to head them, and
kill one at least; then follow and maybe kill more.</p>

<p>But first he drew his big pistol, on the slim
chance of a sure shot, himself. Gradually he thrust
his head beyond the cedar and the rock shoulder—and
jerked back in a jiffy. A fourth buffalo was
standing there almost within touch!</p>

<p>Stub’s heart beat furiously, and he sank trembling,
to think. He must look again; and he did,
as gradually as a timid prairie-dog emerging from
its burrow.</p>

<p>Wah! It was a cow, turned broadside to him,
half dozing as she bathed in the sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>Now he must steady down, and slide out a little
farther, for a sure shot. He huddled back, once
more to take breath. He examined his flint, and
opened the pan, to stir the caked powder of the
priming. Then with both hands he cocked the heavy
hammer—click-click! The noise frightened him,
and he hoped that it had not frightened the cow.
Then he extended the pistol in front of him, and
began to follow it by worming on, inch by inch,
around the low-branching cedar.</p>

<p>Hoorah! The cow was still there, but she had
heard or smelled. Maybe she had heard the click-click.
She had not moved; only, her head was up,
and she was gazing with her head turned in the
direction of the other buffalo.</p>

<p>He’d better shoot as quickly as possible. Another
inch, and another, he squirmed, for right position.
Now! She was about fifteen paces—not so
near as he had thought, but this was the best that
he might do with any safety. So he leveled the
long-barreled dragoon pistol, again with both hands;
held breath until the muzzle seemed to be pointing
directly in line with a spot just behind her fore
shoulder—and while it slightly wavered there, he
pressed the trigger.</p>

<p>Bang! The pistol well-nigh jumped from his
hands; a cloud of smoke had belched—and dimly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
seen through the smoke, by his watering eyes, the
cow had given a great leap and had vanished.</p>

<p>She had run the other way, down the basin. Up
Stub leaped, and ran, too. The basin seemed to be
still echoing with the report, but he heard the thud
and clatter of hoofs, also, and a fear that he had
missed her made his heart sick.</p>

<p>He panted into full sight of the little basin just
in time to see a half score—no, a dozen or more of
the burly animals pelting through for the other end,
to gain the open of the main valley. He’d had no
idea that so many were in here. They’d been hidden
from him, the most of them—lying in cosy beds
where he’d not happened to look.</p>

<p>Away they went, jostling and stringing out, bolting
blindly. One, the last in the flight, loped painfully—fell
farther and farther behind. It was his
cow! He had hit her, and hit her hard. Hoorah!
He darted for the spot where she had stood. He
trailed her for a few steps, and the trampled snow
was blotched red. Blood! Hoorah! He ran on,
down through the basin, to see her again. Now
Baroney or the doctor might get her, because she
would grow weak.</p>

<p>He wondered if they had heard him shoot. The
basin was empty, all the buffalo had charged on into
the valley—that was what he had wished them to do,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
and maybe he had killed one and signaled, besides.
He hoped that the doctor would not be angry.
Now if the buffalo only turned down toward
Baroney——!</p>

<p>Hark! Another shot! Somebody out there had
fired—Whang! He ran faster—to the mouth of
the basin—into sight of the main valley—and again,
hoorah!</p>

<p>The fleeing buffalo had blundered against
Baroney. He had been not far outside; he had shot
one—it was down, in the snow; not the cow, either,
for the cow was down, too—there were the two
black spots, motionless, and the little herd were
streaming across the valley, for the other slope,
with Baroney lumbering after—and yonder, on the
slope, the doctor was plunging toward the bottom,
to get in a shot also.</p>

<p>Could he do it? Yes! He ran quartering, stumbling
and lunging; the leading buffalo sensed him,
swerved, they all swerved; he knelt and aimed and
fired, quickly—around wheeled the buffalo, again
alarmed, and came pelting back for Stub’s side, as
if to escape through their basin—but one lagged,
wavered, halted, and suddenly collapsed. That made
three!</p>

<p>The remainder of the herd were coming straight
for Stub. He had no load for his pistol; he could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
only dance and wave his arms and yell, to stop them.
This he did. Once more they tacked; Baroney had
lain flat, hoping; foolish things, they tacked almost
for him—wait—wait—aha! His gun puffed smoke,
the report echoed dully, a buffalo had jumped high
and stiff-legged and Baroney was after him, loading
on the run. Down pitched the buffalo. That made
four!</p>

<p>The doctor was running again, but the rest of the
buffalo got away, up the valley. All right; they had
left plenty of meat. Hoorah!</p>

<p>Stub hastened forward, wild with joy. The
doctor was coming. They met Baroney, where two
carcasses—a bull and Stub’s cow—were lying close
together.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cheered the doctor.</p>

<p>Baroney capered—“Hoozah! Hoozah!”</p>

<p>“Four! One to me, two to you—that’s good.
And what about this other? Who killed <em>her</em>?”</p>

<p>“The boy. Oui! I think he killed her, with that
pistol,” Baroney jabbered. “I hear one shot—bang!
I do not know where. Then the buffalo come running
out. And before I can shoot, I see this cow
tumble down, and die. She has a hole in her—a
bullet hole.”</p>

<p>“Did you shoot her, Stub? With your pistol?”</p>

<p>Stub nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“First I see three. Down on bottom. They act
scared. I go to drive them out. She very close.
I shoot her. She run, all run, I run. Then I hear
shooting. Baroney get one, you get one, Baroney get
’nother. Now lots of meat. Hoorah!”</p>

<p>“The meat! The meat!” cried Baroney, as if
reminded of great hunger. Down he plumped, digging
furiously with his knife and tearing with his
fingers. He wrested out a strip of bloody flesh and
began to chew it and suck it.</p>

<p>Stub, seeing red, likewise fell to. All of a sudden
he could not wait longer.</p>

<p>“Here, doctor.” And Baroney, his beard stained
wolfish, passed him a piece.</p>

<p>But the doctor straightened up.</p>

<p>“That’s enough. I must carry the news to the
men. You two stay here and butcher what you can
till horses come from the camp. It may be a matter
of life or death for those other fellows. We ought
to get this meat to them without delay.”</p>

<p>And he was away, walking fast and running
down through the valley, for the river beyond and
the main party somewhere along it.</p>

<p>“He’s one fine man,” gasped Baroney, gazing
after. “We think only of our stomach, he thinks
of those others.”</p>

<p>They worked hard, cutting and hacking and hauling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
before the carcasses got cold and the hides stiff.
With Baroney’s hatchet they cracked a marrow-bone
apiece, so as to scoop out the fatty pith.</p>

<p>Presently the sun was high and warming. Two
men were coming afoot up the valley. They brought
no horses——</p>

<p>“Miller and Mountjoy, hein?” Baroney said,
eyeing them as they drew nearer. “Where is the
lieutenant, I want to know?”</p>

<p>Terry Miller and John Mountjoy they were; and
they staggered and stumbled in their haste at sight of
the meat.</p>

<p>“Did you lose the lieutenant? What?”</p>

<p>“No. He’s gone on for camp, with the doctor.
He sent us in here to eat. Give us some meat,
quick.”</p>

<p>“Nothing but one turkey and a hare for the
three of us, these four days past,” panted Terry, as
he and John sucked and gobbled. “And in the last
two days nothing at all.”</p>

<p>“Go far?” Stub queried, eager to know.</p>

<p>“Away up, twenty-five miles or two camps above
where the rest o’ you left us. Up to where the river
petered out to a brook betwixt the mountains. Then
we turned back and traveled day and night with our
clothes froze stiff on us, and our stomachs clean
empty, to ketch the main camp. The cap’n was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
worrying more about the other men than himself.”</p>

<p>“And sure, when we met the doctor, by chance,
with news of this meat, the little cap’n told us to
come in and eat, but he wouldn’t. He went on—him
and the doctor—hungry as he was, to find the camp
below,” mumbled John. “They’ll send hosses. How
many did you kill? Four?”</p>

<p>“Four,” assured Baroney. “Stub one, the doctor
one, I myself had the fortune to kill two. Stub,
he found them; but it was the good God who put
them there, waiting for us.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we might have a bit of a fire, and
eat like Christians, whilst waiting?” Terry proposed
wistfully.</p>

<p>“The marrow is strong; we must not get sick,”
Baroney wisely counseled. “Let us butcher, and be
ready for the horses; and to-morrow we will all
have a big Christmas dinner.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow Christmas?” exclaimed John.
“Right you are! Hooray for Christmas!”</p>

<p>They cheered for Christmas; and with aching
brain Stub puzzled over the new word.</p>

<p>Toward the last of their butchering Corporal
Jerry Jackson and Hugh Menaugh arrived with two
horses. The camp was famished, the lieutenant and
the doctor had toiled in, and now everybody there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
was waiting for the buffalo meat. The camp had
been out of food for two days.</p>

<p>“I told the doctor that the boy an’ his pistol
would fetch him luck,” Hugh declared. “An’ it
surely did. Faith, a fine little hunter you be, Stub,
me lad.”</p>

<p>They loaded the horses, at full speed, and made
for the starving camp. It was a joyous place. John
Sparks had come in with more good news—he had
discovered another buffalo herd and had killed four,
himself! Men and horses were out, to get the meat.</p>

<p>Now with eight buffalo on hand, Christmas Eve
was to be celebrated to-night, and Christmas Day
to-morrow. They were American feasts—feasts for
the Spanish and French and all white people, too,
the doctor and Sergeant Bill said. Stub had heard
the names before, somewhere; perhaps from the
French traders. But he quit thinking and bothering.
He was an American, they were his feasts now;
Lieutenant Pike looked happy, and that was enough.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIV">XIV<br />
<small>A TRAIL OF SURPRISES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The lieutenant had explored the source of this
Red River far enough. He was ready to march on
down, for the plains and the United States post of
Natchitoches above the mouth in Louisiana. Everybody
was glad.</p>

<p>The big meals of buffalo meat had made several
of the men, and Stub also, quite ill; so that on the
day after Christmas the march covered only seven
miles. The tent was turned into a hospital, and the
lieutenant and the doctor slept out in the snow.</p>

<p>The Great White Mountains, far to the east, had
been in sight from high ground; the river appeared
to lead in that direction. But here at the lower
end of the bottom-land other mountains closed in.
The river coursed through, and everybody rather
believed that by following it they all would come
out, in two or three days, into the open.</p>

<p>That proved to be a longer job than expected, and
the toughest yet. The river, ice-bound but full of air-holes,
sometimes broadened a little, and gave hope,
but again was hemmed clear to its borders by tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
precipices too steep to climb. The poor
horses slipped and floundered upon the ice and
rocks; in places they had to be unpacked and the
loads were carried on by hand.</p>

<p>Soon the lieutenant was ordering sledges built,
to relieve the horses of the loads; men and horses
both pulled them—and now and then sledge and
horse broke through the ice and needs must be
hauled out of the water.</p>

<p>Twelve miles march, another of sixteen miles,
five miles, eight miles, ten and three-quarter miles,
about five miles—and the river still twisted, an icy
trail, deep set among the cliffs and pinnacles and
steep snowy slopes that offered no escape to better
country.</p>

<p>The horses were so crippled that some could
scarcely walk; the men were getting well bruised,
too; the dried buffalo meat had dwindled to a few
mouthfuls apiece, and the only game were mountain
sheep that kept out of range. The doctor and
John Brown had been sent ahead, to hunt them and
hang the carcasses beside the river, for the party to
pick up on the way.</p>

<p>From camp this evening the lieutenant and
Baroney climbed out, to the top, in order to see
ahead. They came down with good news.</p>

<p>“We’ve sighted an open place, before,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
the lieutenant, gladly. “It’s not more than eight
miles. Another day’s march, my men, and I think
we’ll be into the prairie and at the end of all this
scrambling and tumbling.”</p>

<p>That gave great hope, although they were too
tired to cheer.</p>

<p>But on the morrow the river trail fought them
harder than ever. Toward noon they had gained
only a scant half mile. The horses had been falling
again and again, the sledges had stuck fast on the
rocks and in the holes, the ice and snow and rocks
behind were blood-stained from the wounds of men
and animals.</p>

<p>Now they had come to a narrow spot, where a
mass of broken rocks, forming a high bar, thrust
itself out from the cliff, into the stream, and where
the water was flowing over the ice itself. The horses
balked and reared, while the men tugged and shoved.</p>

<p>“Over the rocks,” the lieutenant ordered.</p>

<p>That brought more trouble. Stub’s yellow pony,
thin and scarred like the rest, was among those that
still carried light packs. He was a stout, plucky
pony—or had been. Here he lost heart, at last.
His hoofs were sore, he was worn out. Terry
Miller hauled at his neck-thong, Stub pushed at his
braced haunches. The line was in a turmoil, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
everybody worked; the canyon echoed to the shouts
and blows and frenzied, frightened snorting.</p>

<p>Suddenly the yellow pony’s neck-thong snapped;
he recoiled threshing, head over heels, before Stub
might dodge from him; and down they went, together,
clear into the river. <a href="#i_203">But Stub never felt the
final crash.</a> On his way he saw a burst of stars,
then he plunged into night and kept right on plunging
until he woke up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_203">
  <img src="images/i_203.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_203">BUT STUB NEVER FELT THE FINAL CRASH</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>He had landed. No, he was still going. That is,
the snow and cliffs at either side were moving, while
he sat propped and bewildered, dizzily watching
them.</p>

<p>His head throbbed. He put his hand to it, and
felt a bandage. But whose bowed back was that,
just before? And what was that noise, of crunching
and rasping? Ah! He was on a sledge—he was
stowed in the baggage upon a sledge, and was being
hauled—over the ice and snow—through the canyon—by—by——</p>

<p>Freegift Stout! For the man doing the hauling
turned his face, and was Freegift Stout!</p>

<p>Well, well! Freegift halted, and let the sled
run on to him. He shouted also; they had rounded
a curve and there was another loaded sled, and a
man for it; and they, too, stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>“Hello. Waked at last, have ye?” spoke Freegift,
with a grin.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so.” Stub found himself speaking
in a surprisingly easy fashion. A prodigious
amount of words and notions were whirling through
his mind. “Where—where am I, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Ridin’ like a king, down the Red River.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“So’s to get out an’ reach Natchitoches, like the
rest of us.”</p>

<p>Stub struggled to sit up farther. Ouch!</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” he demanded. Then—“I
know. It’s Freegift Stout. That other man’s
Terry Miller. But what’s my name?”</p>

<p>“Stub, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Yes; of course it is. That’s what they call me.
But how did you know? How’d you know I’m
‘Stub’ for short? I’m Jack. That’s my regular
name—Jack Pursley. I got captured by the Utahs,
from my father; did the Pawnees have me, too?
Wish I could remember. I do sort of remember.
But I’m a white boy. I’m an American, from Kentucky.
And my name’s Jack Pursley—Stub for
short.”</p>

<p>Freegift roundly stared, his mouth agape amidst
his whiskers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>“Hey! Come back here, Terry,” he called.
And Terry Miller came back.</p>

<p>“That crack on the head’s set him to talkin’
good English an’ turned him into a white lad, sure,”
quoth Freegift. “Did you hear him? Ain’t that
wonderful, though? His name’s Jack Pursley, if you
please; an’ he answers to Stub, jest the same—an’ if
that wasn’t a smart guess by John Sparks I’ll eat my
hat when I get one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be darned,” Terry wheezed, blinking and
rubbing his nose. “Jack Pursley, are you? Then
where’s your dad?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We were finding gold in the
mountains, and the Indians stole me and hit me on
the head—and I don’t remember everything after
that.”</p>

<p>“Sho’,” said Terry. “How long ago, say?”</p>

<p>“What year is it now, please?”</p>

<p>“We’ve jest turned into 1807.”</p>

<p>“I guess that was three years ago, then.”</p>

<p>“And whereabouts in the mountains?”</p>

<p>“Near the head of the Platte River.”</p>

<p>“For gosh’ sake!” Freegift blurted. “We all
jest come from there’bouts. But you didn’t say
nothin’, an’ we didn’t see no gold.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t remember.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t be goin’ back, though; not for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
all the gold in the ’arth. Were you all alone up
there?”</p>

<p>“My father—he was there. Some other men
had started, but they quit. Then we met the Indians,
and they were friendly till they stole me.”</p>

<p>“Did they kill your father?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“That’s a tall story,” Freegift murmured, to
Terry; and tapped his head. Evidently they didn’t
believe it “Where do you think you are now,
then?” he asked, of Stub.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m with Lieutenant Pike. But where
is he?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll tell you. You see, that yaller hoss
an’ you went down together. You got a crack on
the head, an’ the hoss, he died. We had to shoot
him. But we picked you up, because you seemed
like worth savin’. The lieutenant put a bandage
on you. Then he took the rest of the outfit up out
the canyon. The hosses couldn’t go on—there wasn’t
any footin’. But he left Terry an’ me to pack the
dead hoss’s load an’ some other stuff that he couldn’t
carry, on a couple of sledges, an’ to fetch them an’
you on by river an’ meet him below. Understand?”</p>

<p>Stub nodded. How his brain did whirl, trying
to patch things together! It was as if he had wakened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
from a dream, and couldn’t yet separate the real
from the maybe not.</p>

<p>“We’d best be going on,” Terry Miller warned.
“We’re to ketch the cap’n before night, and we’re
short of grub.”</p>

<p>So the sledges proceeded by the river trail, while
Stub lay and pondered. By the pain now and then
in his head, when the sledge jolted, he had struck
his scar; but somehow he had a wonderful feeling
of relief, there. He was a new boy.</p>

<p>The trail continued as rough as ever. Most of
the way the two men, John and Terry, had to pull
for all they were worth; either tugging to get their
sledges around open water by route of the narrow
strips of shore, or else slipping and scurrying upon
the snowy ice itself. Steep slopes and high cliffs shut
the trail in, as before. The gaps on right and left
were icy ravines and canyons that looked to be
impassible.</p>

<p>The main party were not sighted, nor any trace
of them. Toward dusk, which gathered early, Terry,
ahead, halted.</p>

<p>“It beats the Dutch where the cap’n went to,”
he complained. “He got out, and he hasn’t managed
to get back in, I reckon. Now, what to do?”</p>

<p>“Only thing to do is to camp an’ wait till
mornin’,” answered Freegift. “An’ a powerful lonesome,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
hungry camp it’ll be. But that’s soldierin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, the orders are to ketch him—or to join
him farther down, wherever that may be,” said
Terry. “But we can’t travel by night, in here. So
we’ll have to camp, and foller out our orders
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>It was a lonesome camp, and a cold camp, and
a hungry camp, here in the dark, frozen depths of
the long and silent defile cut by the mysterious river.
They munched a few mouthfuls apiece of dried meat;
Stub slept the most comfortably, under a blanket
upon the sledge; the two men laid underneath a
single deer-hide, upon the snow.</p>

<p>They all started on at daybreak. Stub was
enough stronger so that he sprang off to lighten
the load—even pushed—at the worst places. Indeed,
his head was in first-class shape; the scar pained
very little. And he had rather settled down to being
Jack Pursley again. Only, he wished that he knew
just where his father was. Dead? Or alive?</p>

<p>It was slow going, to-day. The river seemed to
be getting narrower. Where the current had overflowed
and had frozen again, the surface was glary
smooth; the craggy shore-line constantly jutted with
sudden points and shoulders that forced the sledges
out to the middle. The slopes were bare, save for
a sprinkling of low bushes and solitary pines, clinging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
fast to the rocks. Ice glittered where the sun’s
faint rays struck.</p>

<p>This afternoon, having worked tremendously,
they came out into the lieutenant’s prairie. At least,
it might have been the prairie he had reported—a
wide flat or bottom where the hills fell back and let
the river breathe.</p>

<p>“Hooray! Here’s the place to ketch him,”
Freegift cheered. And he called: “See any sign
o’ them, Terry?”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>They halted, to scan ahead. All the white expanse
was lifeless.</p>

<p>“I swan!” sighed Terry. “Never a sign, the
whole day; and now, not a sign here. You’d think
this’d be the spot they’d come in at, and wait for a
fellow or else leave him word.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Freegift, “I would that. Do you
reckon they’re behind us, mebbe?”</p>

<p>“How’s a man to tell, in such a country?” Terry
retorted. “They’re likely tangled up, with half their
hosses down, and the loads getting heavier and heavier.
But where, who knows? We’ll go on a piece,
to finish out the day. We may find ’em lower on,
or sign from ’em. If not, we’ll have to camp again,
and shiver out another night, with nothing to eat.
Eh, Stub? At any rate, orders is orders, and we’re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
to keep travelling by river until we join ’em. If
they’re behind, they’ll discover our tracks, like as
not, and send ahead for us.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, we’re into open goin’. I’m blamed
glad o’ that,” declared Freegift. “Hooray for the
plains, and Natchitoches!”</p>

<p>“Hooray if you like,” Terry answered back, puffing.
“But ’tisn’t any turnpike, you can bet.”</p>

<p>Apparently out of the mountains they were;
nevertheless still hard put, for the river wound and
wound, treacherous with boulders and air-holes,
and the snow-covered banks were heavy with willows
and brush and long grass.</p>

<p>After about four miles Terry, in the lead, shouted
unpleasant news.</p>

<p>“We might as well quit. We’re running plumb
into another set o’ mountains. I can see where the
river enters. This is only a pocket.”</p>

<p>Freegift and Stub arrived, and gazed. The
mountains closed in again, before; had crossed the
trail, and were lined up, waiting. Jagged and gleaming
in the low western sunlight, they barred the way.</p>

<p>“There’s no end to ’em,” said Terry, ruefully.
“Heigh-hum. ’Pears like the real prairies are a long
stint yet. The cap’n will be sore disappointed, if he
sees. I don’t think he’s struck here, though. Anyhow,
we’ll have to camp—I’m clean tuckered; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
to-morrow try once more, for orders is orders, and
I’m right certain he’ll find us somewheres, or we’ll
find him.”</p>

<p>So they made camp. Freegift wandered out,
looking for wood and for trails. He came in.</p>

<p>“I see tracks, Terry. Two men have been along
here—white men, I judge; travellin’ down river.”</p>

<p>“Only two, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Fresh tracks, just the same.”</p>

<p>They all looked, and found the fresh tracks of
two men pointing eastward.</p>

<p>“I tell you! Those are the doctor and Brown
hunting,” Terry proposed. “Wish they’d left some
meat. But we may ketch ’em to-morrow. Even
tracks are a godsend.”</p>

<p>They three had eaten nothing all day; there
was nothing to eat, to-night. To Stub, matters
looked rather desperate, again. Empty stomach and
empty tracks and empty country, winter-bound, gave
one a sort of a hopeless feeling. He and Freegift
and Terry trudged and trudged and trudged, and
hauled and shoved, and never got anywhere. For all
they knew, they might be drawing farther and farther
away from the lieutenant. But, as Terry said,
“orders were orders.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we ketch the doctor he’ll be mighty interested
in that head o’ yourn,” Freegift asserted, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
Stub. “He’s been wantin’ to open it up, I heard
tell; but mebbe that yaller hoss saved him the
trouble.”</p>

<p>“He’ll not thank the hoss,” laughed Terry,
grimly. “He’d like to have done the job himself!
That’s the doctor of it.”</p>

<p>Stub privately resolved to show the doctor that
there was no need of the “job,” now. He felt fine,
and he was Jack Pursley.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred during the night; the false
prairie of the big pocket remained uninvaded except
by themselves. They lingered until about ten o’clock,
hoping that the main party might come in.</p>

<p>“No use,” sighed Freegift. “We may be losin’
time; like as not losin’ the doctor. Our orders were,
to travel by river till we joined the cap’n.”</p>

<p>With one last survey the two men took up their
tow-ropes and, Stub ready to lend a hand when
needed, they plodded on.</p>

<p>The tracks of the doctor and John Brown led to
the gateway before. The space for the river lessened
rapidly. Soon the sides were only prodigious cliffs,
straight up and down where they faced upon the
river, and hung with gigantic icicles and sheeted with
ice masses. The river had dashed from one side to
the other, so that the boulders were now spattered
with frozen spray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>The tracks of the doctor and John Brown had
vanished; being free of foot, they might clamber as
they thought best. But the sledges made a different
proposition. Sometimes, in the more difficult spots
amidst ice, rocks and water, two men and a boy
scarcely could budge one.</p>

<p>Higher and higher towered the cliffs, reddish
where bare, and streaked with motionless waterfalls.
The sky was only a seam. Far aloft, there was
sunshine, and the snow even dripped; but down in
here all was shade and cold. One’s voice sounded
hollow, and echoes answered mockingly.</p>

<p>The dusk commenced to gather before the shine
had left the world above. Stub was just about tired
out; the sweat had frozen on the clothes of the two
men, and their beards also were stiff with frost.</p>

<p>Now they had come to a stopping-place. There
was space for only the river. It was crowded so
closely and piled upon itself so deeply, and was
obliged to flow so swiftly that no ice had formed
upon it beyond its very edges. The cliffs rose
abruptly on either side, not a pebble-toss apart,
leaving no footway.</p>

<p>The trail had ended.</p>

<p>“I cry ‘Enough,’” Terry panted, as the three
peered dismayed. “We can’t go on—and we can’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
spend the night here, either. We’ll have to backtrack
and find some way out.”</p>

<p>“The doctor an’ Brown must ha’ got out somewheres,”
Freegift argued. “They never passed here.
Let’s search whilst there’s light. If we can fetch
out we may yet sight ’em, or the cap’n. An’ failin’
better, we can camp again an’ bile that deer-hide for
a tide-me-over. Some sort o’ chawin’ we need bad.”</p>

<p>“Biled deer-hide for supper, then,” Terry answered.
“It’ll do to fool our stomicks with. But
first we got to get out if we can.”</p>

<p>They turned back, in the gloomy canyon whose
walls seemed to be at least half a mile high, to seek
a side passage up and out. Freegift was ahead.
There were places where the walls had been sundered
by gigantic cracks, piled with granite fragments.
Freegift had crossed the river, on boulders and ice
patches, to explore a crack opposite—and suddenly
a shout hailed him.</p>

<p>“Whoo-ee! Hello!”</p>

<p>He gazed quickly amidst his clambering; waved
his arm and shouted reply, and hastened over.</p>

<p>“Somebody!” Terry exclaimed. He and Stub
ran forward, stumbling. They rounded a shoulder,
and joining Freegift saw the lieutenant. In the
gloom they knew him by his red cap if by nothing
else. He was alone, carrying his gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve been looking for you men,” he greeted.
“You passed us, somehow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Freegift admitted. “An’ we’ve been
lookin’ for you, too, sir. We didn’t know whether
you were before or behind.”</p>

<p>“And begging your pardon, sir, we’re mighty
glad to see you,” added Terry. “Are the men all
behind, the same as yourself, sir?”</p>

<p>“Part of them.” The lieutenant spoke crisply.
“The doctor and Brown are still ahead, I think.
I haven’t laid eyes on them. You three were next.
The rest of the party is split. From the prairie
back yonder I detached Baroney and two men to
take the horses out, unpacked, and find a road for
them. We have lost several animals by falls upon
the rocks, and the others were unable to travel farther
by river. The remaining eight men are coming
on, two by two, each pair with a loaded sledge.
I have preceded them, hoping to overtake you. The
command is pretty well scattered out, but doing the
best it can.” His tired eyes scanned Stub. “How
are you, my brave lad?”</p>

<p>“All right, sir. But my name’s Jack Pursley,
now. That knock I got made me remember.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“You see, sir,” Freegift explained in haste, and
rather as if apologizing for Stub’s answer, “when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
he come to after that rap on the head he was sort
o’ bewildered like; an’ ever since then he’s been
claimin’ that he’s a white boy, name o’ Pursley, from
Kaintuck, an’ was stole from his father, by the
Injuns, up in that very Platte River country where
we saw all them camp sign.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” uttered the lieutenant. “You were
there? How many of you? All white? Where’s
your father? How long ago?”</p>

<p>“About three years, I think,” Stub stammered.
“Just we two, sir. We were hunting and trading
on the plains, with some Kiowas and Comanches,
and the Sioux drove us into the mountains. Then we
joined the Utahs, and after a while they stole me.
They hit me on the head and I forgot a lot of things—and
I don’t know where my father is, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hah! I thought we were the first white men
there,” ejaculated the lieutenant. “The first Americans,
at least. It’s a pity you didn’t come to before.
You might have given us valuable information.”</p>

<p>“He says they found gold in that Platte country,
sir,” said Terry.</p>

<p>“Yes? Pshaw! But no matter now. We’ll pursue
that subject later. First, we must get out of this
canyon. You discovered no passage beyond?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Never space to set a foot.”</p>

<p>“Have you any food?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“Had none for two days, sir. We were thinking
of biling a deer-hide for our supper.”</p>

<p>“You’re no worse off than the others. The
whole column is destitute again, but the men are
struggling bravely, scattered as they may be. The
doctor and Brown came this way. You haven’t
sighted them?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; only their tracks, back a piece.”</p>

<p>“Then they got out, somehow. We must find
their trail before dark, and follow it up top, where
there’s game. Search well; our comrades behind are
depending on us.”</p>

<p>They searched on both sides of the canyon.
Stub’s Indian-wise eyes made the discovery—a few
scratches by hands and gun-stocks, in a narrow
ravine whose slopes were ice sheeted. That was
the place.</p>

<p>They all hurried to the sledges, took what they
might carry, and clawing, slipping, clinging, commenced
to scale the ravine. It was a slow trail, and
a danger trail, but it led them out, to a flat, cedar-strewn
top, where daylight still lingered.</p>

<p>“The doctor and Brown have been here,” panted
the lieutenant. “Here are their tracks.”</p>

<p>They followed the tracks a short distance, and
brought up at camp sign. Evidently the doctor and
Brown had stopped here, the night before; had killed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
a deer, too—but there was nothing save a few shreds
of hide.</p>

<p>“The birds and beasts have eaten whatever they
may have left,” spoke the lieutenant. “Too bad,
my lads. However, we’re out, and we’ll make shift
some way. Fetch up another load, while I hunt.”</p>

<p>Out he went, with his gun. They managed to
bring up another load from the sledges. They heard
a gunshot.</p>

<p>“Hooray! Meat for supper, after all.”</p>

<p>But when he returned in the darkness he was
empty-handed.</p>

<p>“I wounded a deer, and lost him,” he reported
shortly; and he slightly staggered as he sank down
for a moment. “We can do no more to-night.
We’ll melt snow for drinking purposes; but the deer-hide
is likely to make us ill, in our present condition.
We’ll keep it, and to-morrow we’ll have better luck.”</p>

<p>So with a fire and melted snow they passed the
night. Nobody else arrived. The doctor and Brown
seemed to be a day’s march ahead; Baroney and
Hugh Menaugh and Bill Gordon were wandering
with the horses through this broken high country;
and the other eight were toiling as best they could,
with the sledges, in separate pairs, seeking a way out
also.</p>

<p>The lieutenant started again, early in the morning,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
to find meat for breakfast. They went down
into the canyon, to get the rest of the loads, and
the sledges—and how they managed, with their legs
so weary and their stomachs so empty, Stub scarcely
knew.</p>

<p>They heard the lieutenant shoot several times, in
the distance; this helped them. He rarely missed.
But he came into camp with nothing, and with his
gun broken off at the breech—had wounded deer,
had discovered that his gun was bent and shot
crooked—then had fallen and disabled it completely.</p>

<p>He was exhausted—so were the others; yet he
did not give up. He rested only a minute. Then
he grabbed up the gun that had been stowed among
the baggage. It was only a double-barreled shotgun,
but had to do.</p>

<p>“I’ll try again, with this,” he said. “You can go
no further; I see that. Keep good heart, my lads,
and be sure that I’ll return at best speed with the
very first meat I secure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. We’ll wait, sir. And good luck
to ye,” answered Terry.</p>

<p>Sitting numb and lax beside the baggage, they
watched the lieutenant go stumbling and swerving
among the cedars, until he had disappeared.</p>

<p>“A great-hearted little officer,” Freegift remarked.
“Myself, I couldn’t take another step.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
I’m clean petered out, at last. But him—away he
goes, never askin’ a rest.”</p>

<p>“And he’ll be back. You can depend on that,”
put in Terry. “Yes. He’ll not be thinking of himself.
He’s thinking mainly on his men. He’ll be
back with the meat, before he eats a bite.”</p>

<p>They heard nothing. The long day dragged;
sometimes they dozed—they rarely moved and they
rarely spoke; they only waited. Up here it was very
quiet, with a few screaming jays fluttering through
the low trees. Stub caught himself nodding and
dreaming: saw strange objects, grasped at meat, and
woke before he could eat. He wondered if Freegift
and Terry saw the same.</p>

<p>The sun set, the air grew colder.</p>

<p>“Another night,” Freegift groaned. “He’s not
comin’. Now what if he’s layin’ out somewheres,
done up!”</p>

<p>“If he’s still alive he’s on his feet, and seeking
help for us,” Terry asserted. “He said to wait and
he’d come. You can depend on him. Orders be
orders. He found us, below, and he’ll find us here.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to suck deer-hide, then,” announced
Freegift. “It may carry us over.”</p>

<p>They managed to arouse themselves; half boiled
strips of deer-hide in a kettle of snow-water, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
chewed at the hairy, slimy stuff. But they couldn’t
swallow it.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” Terry sighed. “’Tain’t soup nor
meat, nor what I’d call soldiers’ fare at all. We had
hard times before, up the Mississippi with the left’nant;
but we didn’t set teeth to this. What’d I ever
enlist for?”</p>

<p>“The more I don’t know,” answered Freegift.
“But stow one good meal in us an’ we’d enlist over
again, to foller the cap’n on another trip.”</p>

<p>Terry tried to grin.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right. But, oh my! Down the
Red River, heading for white man’s country, is it?
Then where are we? Nowhere at all, and like to
stay.”</p>

<p>Through the gnarled cedars beside the mighty
canyon the shadows deepened. The mountain ridges
and peaks, near and far, surrounding the lone flat,
swiftly lost their daytime tints as the rising tide of
night flowed higher and higher. And soon it was
dark again.</p>

<p>Now they must wait for another morning as
well as for the lieutenant.</p>

<p>They had already sickened of the deer-hide, and
could not touch it again. So the morning was breakfastless.
The sun had been up only a few minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
and Stub was drowsing in a kind of stupor, when
he heard Freegift exclaim:</p>

<p>“He’s comin’, boys! Here comes the cap’n!
Say! Don’t I see him—or not?”</p>

<p>“There’s two of ’em!” cried Terry. “He’s
found company. No! That ain’t the cap’n. It’s
somebody else. But our men, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Two men afoot were hastening in through the
cedars, along the canyon rim. They carried packages—meat!
They were Hugh Menaugh and Bill
Gordon. Hooray!</p>

<p>“Hello to you!”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re still here,” replied Terry. “And
if you’ve fetched anything to eat, out with it quick.
Where’s the cap’n? Did you see him?”</p>

<p>Hugh and Bill busied themselves.</p>

<p>“Yes, we met up with him last evenin’, below,
down river. He hadn’t come back to you, ’cause he
hadn’t killed anything. But Baroney and us were
packin’ buffalo meat and deer meat both, and he sent
us two out to find you first thing this mornin’, soon
as ’twas light enough to s’arch. After you’ve fed,
we’ll help you on to camp.”</p>

<p>“Who else is there?”</p>

<p>“Just the cap’n and Baroney, but they’re expectin’
the doctor and Brown. Them two are somewheres
in the neighborhood. The cap’n fired a gun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
as signal to ’em. We’ll have to look for the other
fellers.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a camp, an’ whereabouts?” Freegift
asked, as he and Terry and Stub greedily
munched.</p>

<p>“Oh, a good camp, in the open, not fur from
the river.”</p>

<p>Hugh and Bill acted oddly—with manner mysterious
as if they were keeping something back.
After the meal, Hugh opened up.</p>

<p>“Now that you’ve eaten, guess I’ll tell you what’s
happened,” he blurted. “You’ll know it, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Anybody dead? Not the cap’n!”</p>

<p>“No. Nothing like that. But this ain’t the
river.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t the Red River?”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>The three stared, dazed.</p>

<p>“What river might it be, then?” gasped Freegift.</p>

<p>“The Arkansaw ag’in. An’ camp’s located on
that very same spot in the dry valley where we struck
north last December, scarce a month ago!”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[G]</a> That was the remarkable and disappointing fact. From
the heads of the Platte River they simply had passed southwestward
to the head of the Arkansas, had fought their way
down through the Grand Canyon of the Arkansas to the Royal
Gorge, and crossing around this were completing a big circle
to the Cañon City region again.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“It’s certainly hard on the little cap’n,” Bill
added. “Yesterday, his worst day of all, when
near dead he made out and espied the landmarks, was
his birthday, too.”</p>

<p>“What’s the date?” Terry queried. “I’ve
forgot.”</p>

<p>“Fifth o’ January. To-day’s the sixth. It was
December 10 when we camped yonder before.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XV">XV<br />
<small>NOT YET DEFEATED</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Helped by Hugh Menaugh and Bill Gordon they
might now travel on for the lieutenant’s camp.
They had to cross several gulches and one or two
ridges; then they came out into view of the dry
valley, at the foot of which the Arkansaw issued
from the mountains, to course eastward through
the foothills and down to the plains far beyond.</p>

<p>It was the same valley. They might see again
the Grand Peak, distant in the north, and mark the
line of the river, nearer in the south. From the
ridges they had been enabled to sight the Great
Snow Mountains, also in the south and much farther
than the Grand Peak in the opposite direction.
Yes, this was the Arkansaw, and the lieutenant
had missed his guess by a wide margin.</p>

<p>He was waiting at the camp. He greeted them
kindly, but was haggard and seemed much cut up
over the result of all his hard marches. No one
could resist being sorry for him.</p>

<p>The doctor and John Brown were here, too.
They had brought in six deer, so that now there was
plenty of meat on hand.</p>

<p>It was two more days before the last of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
men had straggled in. Meanwhile the doctor especially
had been interested in the new “Jack Pursley,”
otherwise Stub; had examined his head, and together
with the lieutenant had asked him questions.
But as Stub stuck to his story, they had to accept
it; appeared rather to believe it—the doctor in
particular.</p>

<p>Considerable of their talk, between themselves,
Stub did not understand. There was something
about “removal of pressure,” “resumption of activity,”
“clearing up of brain area,” and so forth, which
really meant nothing to Stub, except that now he
knew who he was and the spot under his scar no
longer burned or weighed like lead.</p>

<p>If he might only find his father, whose name,
he remembered, was James, and if the lieutenant
might find the Red River after all, then he would
be perfectly happy.</p>

<p>The lieutenant acted somewhat worried. He did
not know quite what to do next. He did not like
to waste time; but instead of having found the Red
River, after a month of search which had lost him
horses and crippled others and almost had lost him
men also, here he was with nothing gained except
a little information about the mountain country
north.</p>

<p>But he was not a man to shilly-shally. He and
the doctor, and sometimes Baroney, talked earnestly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
together; on the day after the last of the squads
had arrived, and when everybody had eaten well
and had rested, he called a council.</p>

<p>“I have decided to make another attempt, men,”
he said. “We are soldiers, and our duty to our
orders and our Flag demands that we do not admit
defeat. The thought of defeat is unworthy of brave
men. It is far better to die with honor, in the knowledge
that we have done our utmost, than to live as
cowards and weaklings. Fortune has been trying
us out, but she will not find us lacking. We have
explored to the north, and we know that the Red
River does not lie there. That much has been
accomplished, and not in vain, for we have made
important discoveries and greatly extended the Government’s
knowledge of the sources of the Platte
and the Arkansaw Rivers. It will be impossible
to travel onward with the horses. We have lost a
number of them, and the remainder are unfit. So I
propose to stay here a few days, in order to erect a
block-house and gather meat. Then I shall leave
the horses, and the useless baggage, with two men
in charge; and with the rest of you shall strike southward
to cross the next divide, in the vicinity of the
Great White Mountains, where, I am positive, we
shall emerge upon the head streams of the Red
River. We have demonstrated the fact that the
Red River can lie only in that direction. From there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
we will send back for the horses, which by that
time will be recovered; and we will descend along
the river to the civilization of our own people and
the just reward, I trust, of a Country appreciative
of your efforts.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Meek faced the men and flourished
his lean arm.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for the cap’n and the Red River,
boys! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!”</p>

<p>They all spent the next four days in building the
block-house with logs, and in hunting. A good
pasture was found, for the wretched horses. John
Sparks made a new stock for the lieutenant’s broken
gun.</p>

<p>Baroney and Pat Smith were to stay here. Although
a great deal of the baggage, including the
lieutenant’s own trunk with his “chief’s” uniform,
was left also, what with the ammunition and axes
and spades, and the presents in case the Comanches
or other Indians should be met, and the meat, the
lieutenant and the doctor and the eleven men carried
each seventy pounds, weighed out equally, and Stub
himself had a pack.</p>

<p>Followed by a good-luck cheer from Baroney
and Pat, they marched out from the block-house on
the morning of January 14, southward bound across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
the Arkansaw, to find the Red River down in the
region of the Great White Mountains.</p>

<p>The first day they marched thirteen miles; the
doctor killed a deer. The second day they marched
nineteen miles, up along a stream that opened a
way for them to the mountains; the lieutenant and
the doctor and John Sparks each killed a deer. On
the third day they marched up the same stream,
eighteen miles, in a snowstorm; and nobody killed
anything. So to-night they pretty well finished
their meat. Travelling afoot in winter was hungry
work, and they could carry only a little at a time.</p>

<p>On the fourth day they marched twenty-eight
miles—and a bad day it proved to be. The Great
White Mountains had been getting nearer, at this
end—their upper end. They formed a tremendous
snowy chain stretching northwest and southeast.
The stream came down from them, and they were
about to bar the trail. Upon the east there were
lesser mountains. But no Red River flowed in this
broad trough between the two ranges; its streams
fed the Arkansaw River; therefore the Red River
must lie upon the farther, or western side, of the
Great White range.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[H]</a> These Great White Mountains of Lieutenant Pike are
the Sangre de Cristo Range of Southern Colorado. They
extend from the Arkansas River above the Grand Canyon clear
into New Mexico, and are a noble snowy range indeed. The
early Spanish explorers from the south named them Sangre de
Cristo, or Blood of Christ, because when first sighted they
were bathed red in the reflection from a New Mexico sunset.
And this frequently is their sunset coloring today. From the
block-house beyond present Cañon City north of the Arkansas
River the Pike men had marched south across the river, and
probably had followed up Grape Creek, which descends from
the east slope of the Sangre de Cristo—the Great White
Mountains.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>The mountains seemed to rise from a bare prairie
which grew no wood. The lieutenant had left the
stream, so as to aim more directly for a low place
in the range; but he was not to cross, to-day. The
range was farther than it looked to be. The sun
set—and here they were, in the cold open, without
wood or water either, or a bite to eat.</p>

<p>“There’s timber at the base of those first slopes,”
he said. “We’ll have to push on, men, until we
reach it. The night will be too cold for existing
with no fires.”</p>

<p>Suddenly they were barred by the creek, and
needs must ford it through ice that broke under
their moccasins. It was long after dark, and was
stinging cold, when they arrived at the trees. The
men stumbled wearily; Stub could not feel his feet at
all. Nobody had complained, though—but when
the fires had been built and they all started to thaw
themselves out, the doctor found that nine pairs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
feet had been frozen, among the men, with Stub’s
pair to be included.</p>

<p>He, and the lieutenant, Sergeant Meek and Terry
Miller were the only ones to have escaped! John
Sparks and young Tom Dougherty were the worst
off. Their feet were solid white to their ankles.
Hugh Menaugh and Jake Carter were badly off, too.
The doctor did his best—everybody rubbed hard with
snow, and several groaned from the pain; but there
was nothing to eat and the thermometer dropped
to more than eighteen degrees below zero or freezing.</p>

<p>With cold, hunger and aching feet it was a hard
night. The lieutenant sent Sergeant Meek and Terry
out early in the morning, to hunt in one direction;
he and the doctor made ready to hunt in another.</p>

<p>“Do the best you can, lads,” they encouraged,
as they set forth. “We’ve all been in tight places
before, and have come out safely. Wait now in
patience, and you shall have the first meat that’s
killed.”</p>

<p>It was another long day: a cold, bleak day for
this open camp on the edge of the snow-laden pines
and cedars, with the Great White Mountains overlooking,
on the one hand, as far as eye might see,
and the wide prairie bottoms stretching lone and
lifeless on the other hand.</p>

<p>Stub’s feet were swollen, puffy and tender, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
he could walk. He and Corporal Jerry Jackson and
Alex Roy managed to keep the fires going. John
Sparks and Tom Dougherty lay suffering until the
sweat stood on their foreheads. Their feet seemed
to be turning black, and were alive with sharp pains.</p>

<p>“Sure, we’re like never to walk ag’in, Tom,”
John moaned. “Our country’ll owe us each a pair
o’ feet.”</p>

<p>“I know that, John. But what’ll we do wid
those we have? That’s what’s botherin’ me. ’Tis
cruel hard.”</p>

<p>“’Tis harder on you than on me, lad,” John
declared. “For you’re young. An’ still, I’d like
to do a bit more marchin’, myself.”</p>

<p>They heard never a sound from the hunters, all
day. At dark the sergeant and Terry Miller came in,
completely tuckered. They had not fired a shot;
had seen no game, nor seen the lieutenant and the
doctor, either.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to pull our belts in another notch,
boys,” quoth the sergeant. “And trust to them
other two. Had they found meat, they’d be in.
If they don’t come to-night, they’ll come to-morrow.
’Tis tough for you, here by the fire; but it’s tougher
on them, out yonder somewheres in the cold, with
their hearts aching at the thought of us waiting and
depending on ’em. Jest the same, I’d rather be any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
one of us, in our moccasins as we are, than Henry
Kennerman serving time in his boots.”</p>

<p>Henry Kennerman was a soldier who had
deserted on the way to the Osage towns.</p>

<p>The next day was the fourth without food. It
passed slowly. The feet of some of the men, like
those of Stub, were much better; but John Sparks
and young Tom could not stand, and Hugh Menaugh
and Jake Carter could not walk.</p>

<p>Toward evening the sergeant grew very uneasy;
alarm settled over them all. No tidings of any kind
had arrived from the lieutenant and Doctor
Robinson.</p>

<p>“We’ll wait, the night,” finally said Sergeant
Meek. “In the morning ’twill be up to us, for if we
sit here longer we’ll be too weak to move. We’ll
divide up, those of us who can walk. A part’ll have
to search for them two men, for maybe they’re needing
help worse’n we are, and ’tis the duty of a soldier
never to abandon his officers. The rest’ll look for
meat again. And we’ll none of us come in till we
fetch either news or meat. Shame on us if we can’t
turn to and help our officers and ourselves.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. There’s nobody can blame the
cap’n an’ the doctor. They’ve never spared themselves.
We’ll all do our best, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“Only lend me a pair o’ fate, any wan o’ yez<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
whose heart’s too heavy for ’em, an’ I’ll look for
the cap’n meself,” appealed Tom Dougherty.</p>

<p>They kept up the fires and tried to sleep. The
black, cold night deepened; overhead the steely stars
spanned from prairie to dark slopes. The Great
Bear of the sky, which contained the Pointers that
told the time, drifted across, ranging on his nightly
trail.</p>

<p>Suddenly, at midnight, they heard a faint, breathless
“Whoo-ee!” And while they listened, another.</p>

<p>“’Tis the cap’n and the doctor!” the sergeant
exclaimed. “Hooray! Give ’em a yell, now, all
together. Build up the fires.”</p>

<p>They yelled. They were answered, through the
darkness—and presently through the same darkness
the lieutenant—and the doctor—came staggering in,
bending low, to the fire-light.</p>

<p>Meat!</p>

<p>“Here you are, my lads!” the lieutenant panted.
He dropped the load from his back, swayed, sank
to his knees, and the sergeant sprang to catch him.</p>

<p>“We’re all right, sir. We knew you’d be coming.
You’re a welcome sight, sir, meat or no meat. We
were getting anxious about you and the doctor, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tend to him, sergeant,” gasped the doctor.
“You be helping the men with the meat. Don’t let
’em over-eat. There’s more, back where we killed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>The lieutenant had almost fainted. It was several
minutes before he could speak again. He and
the doctor had had a terrible two days. The doctor
said that they had wounded a buffalo with three
balls, the first evening, but it had made off. All
that night they had sat up, among some rocks, nearly
freezing to death while they waited for morning.
Then they had sighted a herd of buffalo, at daybreak,
and had crawled a mile through the snow—had
shot eight times, wounded three, and the whole
herd had escaped.</p>

<p>That second day they had tramped until the lieutenant
was about spent with hunger and lack of rest.
Matters had looked very bad. But they both decided
that they would rather die looking for game, than
return and disappoint the men. Just at dusk, when
they were aiming for a point of timber, there to spend
another night, they saw a third herd of buffalo. The
lieutenant managed to run and hide behind a cedar.
When the buffalo were about to pass, he shot, and
this time crippled one. The doctor ran, and with
three more shots they killed the buffalo. Hurrah!</p>

<p>Then they butchered it, without stopping to eat;
and carrying as much as they could they had traveled
for six hours, bringing the meat to the camp.</p>

<p>“It’s a story hard to beat,” said Sergeant Meek,
simply. “You may not be one of the army, yourself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
sir; but as officer and man we’re proud to follow you—you
and the cap’n, sir.”</p>

<p>“The lieutenant and I wondered what you men
were thinking, when we didn’t return,” the doctor
proffered. “You had a right to expect us sooner?
Did you plan to march on and try to save your
lives?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; not exactly that,” replied rugged Sergeant
Meek. “We knew you hadn’t forgotten us,
and there was no complaining. Seemed like we’d
best search for you, and the same time find meat if
we could; and that we’d ha’ done, the first thing in
the morning, sir.”</p>

<p>“Your plan, and the way with which you received
us, do you all credit before the world,” spoke
the lieutenant, who overheard. “As your comrades
we thank you, men; and as your officer I am proud
of you. My reports to General Wilkinson and the
Secretary of War shall not omit the devotion to duty
that has characterized your whole march.”</p>

<small>BLOCKED BY THE GREAT WHITE MOUNTAINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>John Sparks and Tom Dougherty were to be
left behind. That was the word.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The doctor says not a step shall they
march, if they would save their feet; an’ poor Tom,
he’s like to lose his, anyhow. An’ since they can’t
march, no more can we carry ’em across the mountains
without hosses. So here they stay till we can
send an’ get ’em.”</p>

<p>All the buffalo meat had been brought in. The
lieutenant was preparing to march on, for the Red
River. From the camp he had explored farther
westward, to the very foot of the mountains, seeking
a trail over; but the snow was four and five feet deep
even there, the whole country above was white, and
he gave the trail up.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to march on south along this side,
until we find a better place.”</p>

<p>Now they made ready. John Sparks and Tom
were fixed as comfortably as possible, with guns
and ammunition, a lean-to for shelter, and the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
buffalo-robes, and wood and meat. Their packs,
and the packs of Hugh Menaugh and Jake Carter
(who barely could hobble, using their muskets as
crutches) were hidden under trees.</p>

<p>Sturdy red-haired John and young Tom felt
badly. So did everybody. The lieutenant’s voice
broke, as he said:</p>

<p>“We aren’t deserting you, my lads. Never think
of that. As surely as we live we will send for you,
the very first thing, as soon as we locate a desirable
camping spot, to which to bring down the horses.
That will not be long; we have only to cross these
mountains. Rather than desert you, if I should
be the last man alive in the party I would return,
myself, and die with you. Whatever happens, meet
it like soldiers, bearing in mind that you are suffering
for your Country. It is far preferable to perish
thus, in the wilderness, in discharge of duty, rather
than to forfeit honor by evading hardships and toil
like the disloyal Kennerman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir! We’ll act the man, sir,” they replied.
“We’ll keep a stiff upper lip, an’ be waitin’ for the
hosses to come get us.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant shook hands with them; the doctor
shook hands with them.</p>

<p>“Now take care of those feet,” he urged.</p>

<p>Everybody shook hands with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>“Good-by, lads.”</p>

<p>“Good-by to yez. God send yez safe to the Red
River, an’ we’ll join yez there, all bound home
together.”</p>

<p>“For’d, march!” barked the lieutenant. His
voice was husky. There were tears freezing on his
cheeks.</p>

<p>“For’d, men,” rasped old Sergeant Meek, and
blew his nose violently.</p>

<p>A number of the other men were sniffling and
blowing, and Stub choked as he blindly trudged.
Bluff Hugh Menaugh growled gently to himself,
while he and Jake hobbled.</p>

<p>As long as they could see the little camp and the
two figures sitting they occasionally turned and
waved; and John and Tom waved answer.</p>

<p>“Well, we did our best for ’em,” sighed Corporal
Jerry. “We took only one meal o’ meat. They
have the rest. ’Twill get ’em through, like as not.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Once across these mountains, to the Red
River, and we’ll send for them and the hosses.”</p>

<p>This evening the one meal of meat was eaten.
A little snow fell. In the morning the lieutenant
ordered Sergeant Meek to take the party on, while
he and the doctor hunted. The day was dark and
lowering. Then the storm set in again, snowing
furiously. By noon the snow was knee high; they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
could not see ten feet around; Hugh and Jake were
unable to move farther; the lieutenant and the doctor
were still out—perhaps lost, like themselves.</p>

<p>“’Tis no use, men. We’ll make for the nearest
timber and camp there,” ordered Sergeant Meek.</p>

<p>That was another miserably cold, hungry day,
and a worse night.</p>

<p>“How flesh and blood may be expected to stand
more of this, I don’t know,” uttered John Brown.</p>

<p>“And it’s not for you to ask,” the sergeant
sternly rebuked. “If you’re so weak-hearted as to
think them thoughts, keep ’em to yourself. Even
the lad Stub—a mere boy that he is—speaks no such
words. Shame on you—you a soldier!”</p>

<p>John Brown muttered, but said no more.</p>

<p>“Heaven help the cap’n an’ the doctor, again,”
spoke Corporal Jerry, as they all huddled about
their fire, and the wind howled and the snow hissed,
and the drifts piled higher against their little bulwark
of packs. “An’ if they don’t find us an’ we don’t
find them, ’twill go hard with Sparks and Dougherty,
too.”</p>

<p>“If the storm clears, we’ll march on in the morning,”
said Sergeant Meek. “We’ve had orders to
meet ’em, on a piece yet, and that’s our duty.”</p>

<p>The morning dawned gray and white, but the
storm had ceased. They shook off the snow, reshouldered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
their packs, and guns in hand stiffly
started. The snow was thigh high; the Great White
Mountains looming in a long front without end on
their right were whiter than ever; the bottoms and
the more distant mountains on their left were white.
It was snow, snow, snow, everywhere; the very dead
of winter.</p>

<p>Now (Good!) here came the lieutenant and the
doctor, ploughing down a slope, their packs on their
backs, but nothing else. Snowy and breathing hard,
they arrived. The men, plodding, had seen; and
having given up hope plodded on, saying not a word.
Only Sergeant Meek greeted, saluting as best he
might:</p>

<p>“All well, cap’n. Good morning to you, sirs.”</p>

<p>“No luck this time, sergeant,” wheezed the lieutenant,
cheerily, but with face pinched and set. “We
missed you, and spent the night together in the snow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. We couldn’t see, for the storm, sir,
and had to camp in the nearest shelter.”</p>

<p>“You did right, sergeant. The storm was so
thick that I found even the compass of little help.
The doctor and I became separated and were fearful
that we had lost each other as well as the party.
Halt the men.”</p>

<p>“Squad, halt,” rasped the sergeant.</p>

<p>The men waited, panting and coughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>“It’s evident there are no buffalo down in the
open, lads,” spoke the lieutenant. “The doctor and
I have sighted never a one nor any sign of one.
The storm has driven them back and higher, into the
timber. We’ll make in the same direction, and be
crossing the mountains while seeking meat.”</p>

<p>He and the doctor led off, heading westward, to
climb the Great White Mountains. The route commenced
to get more rolling—up and down, up and
down, over the rounded foothills concealed by the
snow. ’Twas leg-wearying, breath-taking work.
The snow grew deeper. In the hollows it had gathered
shoulders high; upon the slopes it was waist
high. The little column was straggling. Stub, the
smallest member, trying to tread in the broken trail,
was at times almost buried.</p>

<p>In an hour they all had covered a pitiful distance;
to be sure, the prairie was somewhat below,
but the real mountains seemed far above, and the
silent timber still awaited, in a broad belt.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor had halted. They
turned and began to plough back. The little column,
steaming with the vapor from lungs and bodies, drew
nearer to them.</p>

<p>“The snow is too deep, here, lads,” the lieutenant
called, as he and the doctor passed in front of the
file. His voice was tired; anybody might have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
thought him discouraged—and little wonder. “We’ll
have to keep lower down, and try elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“To the famine country of the open bottoms,”
he said. Were they never to get across these Great
White Mountains, which faced them unending?
Were they to die in the snow, just for the sake of
hunting the Red River? John Brown, near the head
of the column, broke restraint again and exclaimed
roundly:</p>

<p>“I say, it’s more than flesh an’ blood can bear,
to march three days with not a mouthful of food,
through snow three feet deep, an’ carry loads only
fit for hosses!”</p>

<p>Everybody heard. Sergeant Meek turned on him
angrily. Had the lieutenant heard also? No? Yes!
He had paused for an instant, as if to reply; then
without another sign he had proceeded.</p>

<p>“You’ll be called to answer for this, Brown,”
warned the sergeant.</p>

<p>John muttered to himself, and a silence fell upon
the file. Stooped and unsteady under their own
loads, the lieutenant and the doctor doggedly continued,
breaking the trail on course obliquing for
the lower country. The others followed, breathing
hard.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor had struck down
a shallow draw. Issuing from the end of it, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
were out of sight. When the head of the column
arrived at the same spot, there were only the two
packs, and a message scrawled with a ramrod on
the snow. Sergeant Meek read.</p>

<p>“We see buffalo. Camp in nearest timber and
wait. Z. M. P.”</p>

<p>Every eye sprang to search the landscape. There!
Far down, upon the prairie! Black dots—slowly
moving across! Buffalo! And where were the
hunters? Their tracks pointed onward from the
two packs. See! They were running, crouched,
down among the billowy swells, as if to head the
animals off. It was a desperate chance.</p>

<p>“The breeze is with us,” Sergeant Meek cried
hopefully. “Quick! For that timber tip, yon,
and keep out o’ sight. Trust the cap’n and the doctor
to do their best. Let’s take no risk of spoiling
their chance.”</p>

<p>The column hustled, with strength renewed. The
tip of timber was about a mile distant. The buffalo
had disappeared behind a knoll of the prairie; the
last seen of the lieutenant and the doctor, they
were hastening—stumbling and falling and lunging
again, to reach the same knoll. The doctor had
forged ahead. He was stronger than the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Then the scene was swallowed up by a dip in the
trail to the timber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>Next, a dully-sounding gunshot! But only one.
The doctor probably had fired—perhaps at long distance.
Had he landed—disabled, or only wounded,
or missed? Nothing could yet be seen. The men,
and Stub, their lungs almost bursting, shambled as
fast as possible. Just as they emerged at the point
of timber, other shots boomed: two, close together.
Hooray! That meant business. They paused, puffing,
to gaze.</p>

<p>Again hooray! Down near the knoll a black spot
blotched the snow. At one side of it there were
other black spots, some still, some moving in and out.
It was the herd, and seemed confused. Look! From
the black spot, off by itself—a dead buffalo, that!—smoke
puffs darted and spread. The buffalo herd
surged a little, but did not run. The lieutenant and
the doctor were lying behind the carcass and
shooting.</p>

<p>“One, anyway, lads!” cheered Sergeant Meek.
“Maybe more. Off with your packs, now. Roy,
Mountjoy, Stout, Brown, you cut wood; the rest
of us’ll be clearing a space. There’ll be meat in camp
before long, and we’ll have fires ready.”</p>

<p>They all worked fast. No one now felt tired.
The hunt down below sounded like a battle. The
lieutenant and the doctor were firing again and again,
as rapidly as they might load and aim. Toiling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
with ax and spade and hands, the column, making
camp, scarcely paused to watch; but presently the
firing ceased—the buffalo herd were lumbering away,
at last, with one, two, three of them gradually dropping
behind, to stagger, waver, and suddenly pitch,
dead! Meat, and plenty of it!</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor were busy, butchering
the carcass that had shielded them. They wasted
no time. Here they came, loaded well. The fires
were crackling and blazing, in readiness; and when
they panted in, spent, bloody and triumphant, the
camp cheered hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Eat, boys,” gasped the lieutenant. “Fortune
has favored us. There’s more meat below. But
we’ll eat first.”</p>

<p>Everybody hacked and tore at the red humps,
and in a jiffy the strips from them were being thrust
into the fire by ramrods; without waiting for more
than a scorching and a warming through, the men
devoured like wolves. With the meat juice daubing
his chin and staining the men’s beards, Stub thought
that never before had he tasted such sweetness. He
forgot his other hungers.</p>

<p>Whew! One by one the men drew back, to chew
the last mouthfuls, and light pipes, contented. The
meat all had vanished.</p>

<p>“Send Brown to me, sergeant,” the lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
ordered. There was something <em>he</em> had not forgotten.</p>

<p>John Brown arose and shambled to where the
lieutenant and the doctor were sitting. He looked
sheepish and frightened. The lieutenant stood, to
front him; did not acknowledge his salute, but
scanned him sternly, his haggard eyes commencing
to blaze bluely.</p>

<p>“Brown, you this day presumed to make use of
language that was seditious and mutinous; I then
passed it over, pitying your situation and laying
your conduct to your distress from hunger, rather
than to desire to sow discontent amongst the party.
Had I saved provisions for ourselves, whilst you
were starving,” reproached the lieutenant; “had we
been marching along light and at our ease, whilst you
were weighed down with your burden, then you
would have had some excuse for your remarks: but
when we all were equally hungry, weary, worn, and
charged with burdens which I believe my natural
strength is less able to bear than any man’s in the
party—when we are always foremost in breaking
the road, reconnoitering and enduring the fatigues
of the chase, it was the height of ingratitude in you
to let an expression escape that showed discontent.
Your ready compliance and firm perseverance I had
reason to expect, as the leader of men who are my
companions in misery and danger. But your duty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
as a soldier (the young lieutenant’s voice rang, and
his eyes flashed) called on your obedience to your
officer, and a suppression of such language. However,
for this time I will pardon; but I assure you,
should that ever be repeated, I will answer your ingratitude
and punish your disobedience by instant
death.”</p>

<p>John Brown had shrunk and whitened.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he faltered. “Thank you, sir. I’ll
remember. It shan’t happen again.”</p>

<p>“You may go.” The lieutenant’s eyes left
Brown’s face and traveled over the other men. “I
take this opportunity,” he said, “likewise to express
to you, soldiers, generally, my thanks for your obedience,
perseverance, and ready contempt of every
danger, which you have in common shown. And
I assure you that nothing shall be lacking on my
part to procure you the rewards of our Government
and the gratitude of your countrymen.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for the cap’n, lads,” shouted Sergeant
Meek. “Hooray, now! Hooray! Hooray!”</p>

<p>“We’re with you to the end, sir!”</p>

<p>“We’re not complainin’, sir. No more is
Brown.”</p>

<p>“You’re the leader, sir, and we’re proud to
follow.”</p>

<p>“Sure, you an’ the doctor do the hard work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>Thus they cried, bravely and huskily; for who
could help loving this stanch little officer, who asked
no favors of rank, except to lead, and who now
stood before them, in his stained red fur-lined cap,
his wet, torn blanket-coat, his bedraggled thin blue
trousers and soaked, scuffed moccasins. He was all
man.</p>

<p>He raised his hand. His face had flushed, his
eyes had softened moistly, and his lips quivered.</p>

<p>“That will do, lads. We understand each other,
and I’m sure Brown will not repeat his offense. For
my part, I am determined that we shall not move
again without a supply of food. That imperils our
success, and is more than our duty would require
of us.”</p>

<p>“Still, we might have made good, hadn’t we left
the bulk of our meat with Sparks and Dougherty,
back yonder,” Freegift Stout remarked, to the others
in his mess. “That’s what pinched us.”</p>

<small>THE FORT IN THE WILDERNESS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Across the Great White Mountains at last!</p>

<p>That had proved to be not such a hard trip, after
all, although uncomfortable on account of the snow.
First, the meat from the other buffalo (three) had
been brought into camp—had been sliced and the
strips hung on frames, to dry. There was a great
quantity of it; more than could be carried on foot.
So Hugh Menaugh, whose frozen feet still crippled
him badly, was left to guard the extra amount, at
this supply depot; and, loaded well, the twelve others
marched on.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor led into the mountains.
Now was the time to cross while the men had
meat and felt strong. In spite of the snow three
feet deep they made fourteen miles, following the
low places; and at evening they were over—they had
come upon a stream flowing west! It surely was a
feeder of the Red River!</p>

<p>Again they all cheered. But if they were over,
they were not yet through, for ahead they could see
only the same bald or timbered swells and ridges,
snow-covered and still without end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>Near noon, the next day, the lieutenant and the
doctor, in the advance as usual, turned and gladly
beckoned, and pointed before. They all hastened.
The signs were good—the brush had been flattened
or cut off, down a long draw, and the trees had been
blazed and curiously painted with rude figures. It
was an Indian pass.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor had gone on.
When the others arrived at the spot, they saw.</p>

<p>“We’re coming out, boys!”</p>

<p>“We’ll be out before night!”</p>

<p>A separate, distant range of mountains might be
sighted, through the gap made by the blazed trail;
and below, nearer, there was glimpse of the low
country, bordered on this side by bare sandy foothills
of these Great White Mountains themselves.</p>

<p>At sunset they were down and into the open,
between the timbered slopes and the rolling sand-hills.
On the west, beyond the sand-hills there appeared
to be a wide valley; and beyond the valley
that other range of mountains.</p>

<p>Camp had to be made soon, here at the base of
the Great White Mountains. The lieutenant went
out alone, to climb the sand-hills, for a view. They
could see him, a small figure, toiling up and standing,
to peer through his spy-glass. He came back in the
dusk, but his face was aglow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>“I have good news,” he announced. “We have
won success. With the glass I can see from those
sand-hills a larger river coursing from northwest to
southeast through the valley beyond. There can be
no doubt that it is the Red River.”</p>

<p>They cheered and cheered, and ate with fine appetites.
It was a happy night. As Sergeant Meek
said:</p>

<p>“Once there—and ’twon’t be long—we can send
back for Menaugh, and poor Sparks and Dougherty,
and Baroney and Smith and the hosses; and we’ll all
be together again, ready for the march home.”</p>

<p>The sand-hills were five miles wide, and looked
to be about fifteen miles long. The river came down
obliquely through the valley—which was indeed a
broad bottom of prairie-land; so they cut across at an
angle, and not until the second evening, after a day’s
march of twenty-four miles, did they reach the bank
of the river itself, January 30.</p>

<p>It certainly was the Red River, issuing from the
western mountains, and here turning more southwardly,
in the middle of the valley.</p>

<p>The valley was a wonderland. It lay flat, with
little snow, full fifty miles wide and in length almost
farther than eye might say. The mountains in the
west were bald, snowy and grim. The Great White
Mountains on the east appeared to end opposite in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
huge, dazzling peak with three crests, but a lower
range veered in, narrowing the valley in the south.
Afar in the north, the valley was closed completely.</p>

<p>The bottoms were dotted with herds of deer,
browsing on the thick dried grasses. Many smaller
streams joined the big river.</p>

<p>“Aye, ’tis a hunters’ paradise, this,” sighed Freegift
Stout. “We’re in a land o’ plenty. We can
send back word that’ll gladden the hearts of the
boys behind.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant had decided to make a fortified
camp, so as to have protection from the Indians and
perhaps from the Spanish while the men behind
were being sent for and boats were being built. He
intended to descend the Red River by boat and horse,
both.</p>

<p>There was no timber at this spot. Some appeared
lower along the river. They marched for it—eighteen
miles. The larger trees were across the river;
therefore the lieutenant led across, also, by way of
the ice and several islands. Then they came to
another river, that looked like a fork, entering from
the west. About five miles from its mouth the
lieutenant found a good place. The fort should be
here.</p>

<p>It was a small piece of level bottom, grown to
cottonwood trees on the north side of this west fork.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
The fork was all open water, about thirty paces wide.
Opposite, on the south side, there was a high, partly
bare hill, out of gunshot.</p>

<p>The next morning, which was February 1, the
lieutenant staked a plan of the fort, on the ground.
Axes rang, spades scraped, picks thudded. As soon
as the fort was far enough along so that it would
stand an attack, a party should be sent back across
the Great Snowy Mountains to get the other men
and the horses.</p>

<p>“But what I’d like to know, is, what are we
doin’ on this side the main river?” queried Corporal
Jerry, that night.</p>

<p>“To get at the big trees, and because ’tis the
proper place for the fort,” answered Sergeant Meek.</p>

<p>“Yes, maybe. But bein’ as this is the Red
River, we’re on the Spanish side, ain’t we? From all
I hear, the Red River’s the dividin’ line betwixt the
United States an’ Mexico, an’ we’re across it into
Mexican territory.”</p>

<p>“That’s not for you or me to say, my boy,” Sergeant
Meek retorted. “The cap’n has his orders,
you can bet, and all we need do is to foller him. But
sure, this is a fork, at the head-waters, and we’re
on the north side the fork. In a bit more we’ll be
starting on down, like as not keeping safe to our own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
side again. And meanwhile if the Spanish tackle
us here, all the worse for ’em. Not the whole Spanish
army could budge us from this fort when it’s
done. I wouldn’t mind having a dust with ’em, for a
change from shooting buff’lo and deer.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. A dust at real fightin’ would
serve to pass the time, sergeant,” the others cried.
“Didn’t we foller ’em, an’ didn’t they lead us
wrong?”</p>

<p>“Or else we led ourselves wrong, mistaking
Injun trail for white man trail. At any rate, here
we are; and as soon as the ice breaks—which won’t
be long—we’ll all be marching on, for home.”</p>

<p>The fort was to be a strong one. Lieutenant
Pike, who took great pride in it, explained the scheme,
himself, to Stub.</p>

<p>“Thirty-six feet square, inside, fronting upon
the river, where the current is too deep to ford.
Bastions (which were small block-houses) at the two
rear corners, to cover the walls on three sides. The
walls, six feet up, of large cottonwood logs two feet
through. Smaller logs to be laid for another six
feet. A ditch will be dug all around, inside, and
sloped off toward the walls, for pickets to rest in.
The pickets will be sharpened and will slant two
and one-half feet over the top of the walls, like a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
fringe, so that nobody can climb in. All around,
outside, there will be a deep ditch four feet wide, and
filled with water. This is called a moat. We will
cut a row of loopholes in the walls, eight feet up; the
men will stand upon platforms, to shoot through.
Our only entrance will be a hole, about the size of a
man’s body, low down, on the river side; and to use
it, everybody will have to crawl in or out on his
stomach, and cross the big ditch by means of a plank.
There will be no roof; this is what is called a stockade.
But the men doubtless will construct shelters
of brush.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be a soldier yet,” the doctor laughed,
to Stub, overhearing the explanation.</p>

<p>“Entrenched here we need have no fear of one
hundred Spanish troops,” the lieutenant remarked.
“We could easily stand them off for a day or two;
then by a sally at night either disperse them, or make
our escape in the darkness, before our supplies were
exhausted.”</p>

<p>“And Indians?”</p>

<p>“They would be less dangerous, unless they
sent word to Santa Fe in the south. We would
endeavor to treat with them, which is one of the
purposes of the expedition.”</p>

<p>Jake Carter and Alex Roy were not able to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
much, on account of tender feet. The other men
worked hard, building the stockade around the
American flag that had been planted on a pole, in the
center. The lieutenant and Doctor Robinson hunted
and explored. Stub frequently went with them, to
help bring in the meat.</p>

<p>Once they discovered a group of springs, at the
base of the hill south of the fork and opposite the
stockade. These were warm springs, and strangely
colored, brown and yellow. Their warm water was
what kept the fork open, clear to the main river
and for some distance down below the mouth of the
fork.</p>

<p>They discovered also a well-traveled trail up
along an eastern branch of the main river, not far
above the western fork. It was a horse trail. Camps
beside it showed that soldiers—probably Spanish—had
used it. So the Spanish came in here.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the doctor talked considerably
of Santa Fe, the capital of New Mexico. It lay
somewhere south. The lieutenant was anxious to
know more about it, so as to make report upon it
to the United States government. He could not
leave the stockade, himself, but the doctor arranged
to go.</p>

<p>Evidently this had been the plan for some time.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
A trader by the name of William Morrison, in the
United States, had sent goods there, three years
ago, in charge of another man named Baptiste
Lalande, to be sold. But Lalande had never come
back with the money. Doctor Robinson had agreed
with William Morrison to visit Santa Fe, if near
there, and collect the money. This would be an
excuse for spying around.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week, when the stockade
was partially finished, the doctor left for Santa Fe.
He set out westward, up the south bank of the fork
(which was the wrong direction, although none of
them knew it), and promised to return with his
report in a week or ten days.</p>

<p>The men were not so certain about this. Sergeant
Meek wagged his grizzled head dubiously.</p>

<p>“Not to criticize a superior officer, but strikes
me it’s a risky move. The doctor’s pure grit, all
right enough, to head alone through a country full
o’ Injun sign and Spanish sign to boot, and he’s like
to run his foot into a wolf trap. For if he gets
there, them Spanish will be curyus to know where
he come from; and what’s to prevent their back-trailing
him? Oh, well; there’s something afoot that we
don’t understand. Our duty’s to obey orders, and
if the lieutenant says for us all to go to Santy Fee,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
go we will. But we’ll not go there by any orders
o’ the Spanish.”</p>

<p>This evening Corporal Jerry Jackson was started
out, to get John Sparks and Tom Dougherty, if he
could, and also Hugh Menaugh, on the other side
of the mountains. He took with him Freegift Stout,
William Gordon, John Brown and John Mountjoy.</p>

<p>That left in the stockade only the lieutenant,
Sergeant Meek, Terry Miller, Jake Carter and Alex
Roy (whose feet had been badly frozen), and Stub.
They missed the doctor, and Corporal Jerry’s squad,
but could get along for a few days.</p>

<p>This was February 7. No word might be expected
from the doctor or Corporal Jerry for at least
a week. Nothing especial happened during the week.
The men and Stub kept on laboring at the stockade,
the lieutenant read in a French book a great deal,
or hunted for deer, taking Stub as companion.</p>

<p>By the sixteenth the walls of the stockade were
about done, and the inside ditch, for the pickets,
was being pecked out—a slow job in the frozen
earth. Nine days had passed, and still there was
no sign from the doctor or Corporal Jerry. This
morning the lieutenant and Stub went out hunting
again, down the main river. The lieutenant carried
his favorite musket—the one whose grip had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
mended. Stub wore a pistol, the mate to Hugh
Menaugh’s, borrowed from the lieutenant.</p>

<p>They had tramped about six miles, had just
wounded a deer and were trailing it, when the lieutenant
suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Halt. Be quiet. Somebody’s coming.”</p>

<p>Two strangers, horseback, were topping a rise,
half a mile before and a little on the right or west.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVIII">XVIII<br />
<small>VISITORS FROM THE SOUTH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Not wild Indians; Spanish, rather,” mused the
lieutenant, as, standing motionless, he and Stub
gazed. “Hah! They may be videttes (scouts) from
a large party, or they may be hunters like ourselves.
We’ll turn back, my boy; not from fear but to avoid
trouble if possible.”</p>

<p>So they turned back, in the direction of the
stockade. Glancing behind, Stub saw the two horsemen
descending the hill at a gallop.</p>

<p>“They’re coming, lieutenant. They’ve seen us.”</p>

<p>“The sound of our gun no doubt attracted them
first. They seem to be alone. Very well. They
must not be permitted to think that we’re afraid of
them. Should they persist in coming on, we’ll
face them.”</p>

<p>The two horsemen did come on, flourishing their
lances as if in a charge. They were closing the gap
rapidly—were within gunshot, when the lieutenant
barked the brisk order:</p>

<p>“Now! Face about! We’ll show them the muzzles
of our guns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>They turned, and leveled musket and pistol. The
two horsemen instantly pulled their mounts short,
whirled, and bending low scudded away. In a short
distance they halted, and sat waiting.</p>

<p>“We’ll advance on them,” quoth the lieutenant.</p>

<p>But the first few steps sent the pair scurrying
in retreat again.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the lieutenant. “They respect
our weapons and see we do not fear theirs. Maybe
they’ll let us take our way.”</p>

<p>However, when he and Stub proceeded on the
trail for the stockade, on came the two horsemen
in another charge. The lieutenant ordered a face-about—and
away the two scampered, as before.
This game was repeated several times. The stockade
was not in sight, and the lieutenant was growing
angry.</p>

<p>“We’ll make an end to this, Stub.” His face
had flushed. “I do not propose to be badgered. It
is beneath the dignity of an American officer and
soldier to be toyed with in such child’s play. Pay
no further attention to them until we round that
shoulder yonder. Then we’ll slip into a ravine there
and see if we can’t lure them to close quarters that
will bring them to account.”</p>

<p>It was back-tickling work, to trudge on, never
turning, with those lances threatening, closer and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
closer, behind. But the lieutenant gave no sign—until,
when around the shoulder and for a moment
out of sight by the pursuit, he sprang aside.</p>

<p>“Quick, now!”</p>

<p>They dived for cover and found it in a heap of
large, brush-screened rocks. They waited, peering
and listening. Pretty soon they might hear the
hoofs of the horses. The two riders cantered into
sight. They were quite near. One was black-bearded—wore
a large ribboned hat and blue and red
coat and leathern leggins, the same as Lieutenant
Melgares’ soldiers had worn. He was a Spanish
dragoon. He carried a lance, a shield and short
musketoon or escopeta hung at his saddle.</p>

<p>The other was dark, without whiskers: an Indian.
He wore a blue cotton shirt and leggins
wrapped in white from moccasins to knees. His
hair fell in two braids. He, also, carried a lance and
shield.</p>

<p>They saw nobody ahead of them, and began to
move cautiously, craning, and checking their horses.
Little by little they came on. Now they were within
forty paces.</p>

<p>“This will do,” the lieutenant whispered. “We
have them. Lay down your pistol and stand up
so they can see you’re unarmed. Then walk out.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
I’ll follow and cover them. If they show sign of
harm, I’ll fire upon them instantly.”</p>

<p>Stub bravely stood into full view and spread
his empty hands. He was not afraid; not while
Lieutenant Pike was backing him.</p>

<p>The two horsemen were completely surprised.
They reined in and sat poised and gawking, on the
verge of flight. But the lieutenant’s gun muzzle held
them fast, while Stub walked toward them, his hand
up in the peace sign. The lieutenant called:</p>

<p>“Amigos (Friends)! Americanos (Americans)!”
And he must have beckoned, for the two
timidly edged forward, ready to run or to fight. Evidently
they would rather run.</p>

<p>The lieutenant advanced also, and joined Stub.</p>

<p>“Take your pistol. Here it is. We’ll talk with
them. Do you know Spanish?”</p>

<p>“I’ve forgotten,” Stub stammered.</p>

<p>“We’ll manage with signs and the few words
we do know. At the same time we must stand prepared
to fire.”</p>

<p>“Where are you from?” he queried sharply, in
French.</p>

<p>The dragoon seemed to understand.</p>

<p>“From Santa Fe, señor.”</p>

<p>“How far is Santa Fe?”</p>

<p>“Three days as we come, señor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“We hunt.”</p>

<p>They got off their horses, and led them in nearer;
then they smiled friendly, and sat down and rolled
themselves smokes. The lieutenant and Stub warily
sat down, opposite. It was a little council. Stub
eyed the Indian. He was a tame Indian—one of the
house-building Indians from the south: a Pueblo.</p>

<p>“What do you hunt?” asked Lieutenant Pike.</p>

<p>“Game, señor. Do you hunt, also?”</p>

<p>“We travel down the Red River, to the American
fort of Natchitoches.”</p>

<p>“Another stranger has arrived, in Santa Fe.
His name is Robinson. He is an American. The
governor received him well. He comes from your
party?”</p>

<p>“There is no such man in my party,” the lieutenant
answered; which was true, now.</p>

<p>Presently he arose. It was difficult talking by
signs and short words.</p>

<p>“A Díos, señores. A pleasant journey to you.”</p>

<p>“One moment, señor,” begged the dragoon.
“Where is your camp?”</p>

<p>“It is far; we have several camps. So good-by.”</p>

<p>He and Stub started on. But the dragoon and
the Indian mounted their horses and followed. They
were determined to find the camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>“They are spies,” said the lieutenant. “We cannot
get rid of them without trouble, and I have
orders to avoid trouble. We shall have to take
them in.”</p>

<p>So he and Stub waited, and it was just as well,
for soon the regular trail up river to the stockade
was reached; the two horsemen struck into it, and
forged ahead, peering eagerly. The trail crossed
the fork above the stockade—and the first thing the
two horsemen knew they were stopped in short order
by Alex Roy who was posted as sentinel.</p>

<p>That astonished them again. They could just
glimpse the stockade, they heard Alex challenge
them, and saw his gun—and ducking and dodging
they raced back, to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Do not fear. Come,” he spoke.</p>

<p>He led them on; they left their horses outside,
and, still frightened, followed him and Stub through
an opening in the stockade, which was being used
until the ditch and the hole were ready.</p>

<p>They stayed all that day. The men had orders
to watch them, but not to talk with them. They
stared about as much as they could. They asked
several times where the Americans’ horses were, and
how many men the lieutenant had. Lieutenant Pike
said that these were only a part of his men, and
that he had marched without horses, through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
snow. He was going down the Red River, holding
councils with the Indians on the borders of the
United States. If the governor at Santa Fe would
send somebody who spoke good French or English,
he would explain everything.</p>

<p>The dragoon and the Pueblo did not believe;
and when they rode away in the morning they were
as suspicious as ever. They said they would be in
Santa Fe in two days with the lieutenant’s message
to the governor, whose name was Don Joaquin del
Real Alencaster. The lieutenant had given them a
few presents, which appeared to please them. The
Pueblo gave the lieutenant some deer meat, part
of a goose, a sack of meal and pieces of flat, hard-baked
bread.</p>

<p>Everybody was glad to see them go, but——</p>

<p>“It’s an ill wind that brought ’em,” Sergeant
Meek remarked. “Not blaming him or the cap’n,
the doctor did it. To be sure the Spanish would
set out to s’arch the country. Unless I’m mistaken,
we’ll see more of ’em.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant thought the same. He ordered
that the work of finishing the stockade be rushed,
and even lent a hand himself. He had no idea
of leaving until Hugh, and John Sparks and
Tom, across the mountains, and Baroney and Pat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
Smith, on the Arkansaw with the horses, had been
brought in.</p>

<p>It was high time that Corporal Jerry and party
turned up. They had been gone a long while, and
were needed. Five men and a boy were a small
garrison. This evening Corporal Jerry, with John
Brown, William Gordon and John Mountjoy, did
arrive. After he had reported to the lieutenant, he
told his story to the rest of them.</p>

<p>“Yes, we found Hugh, but we had to cross in
snow middle deep, to do it. He’s comin’ on with
Freegift. They’ll be down to-morrow. We went
back to Sparks an’ Dougherty, too.”</p>

<p>“How are they?”</p>

<p>“Bad off. Ah, boys, ’twould melt your hearts
to see ’em. They sheer wept when we hailed ’em.
They’ve got food enough yet, even after the near
two months; but they can scarce walk a step. Their
feet are gone, an’ they’ve hardly a finger between
’em. So we couldn’t move ’em; not through the
snow of the passes. We did what we could to cheer
’em up, but when we left they acted like they never
expected to see us again. Yes; an’ they sent over
bones from their feet, for the cap’n, an’ made me
promise to give ’em to him as a token an’ to beg
him, by all that’s sacred, not to let the two of ’em
die like beasts, alone in the wilds. When I gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
him the bones an’ told him, he turned white an’ his
eyes filled up. ‘They should know me better than
that,’ said he. ‘Never would I abandon them. To
restore them to their homes and their country again
I’d carry the end of a litter, myself, through snow
and mountains for months.’”</p>

<p>“He’d do it,” asserted Sergeant Meek. “And
so would any of us. Bones from their feet, is it?
Who but a soldier would lose the smallest joint for
such a pittance of pay, even to serve his country?
Surely the Government won’t lose sight o’ men like
poor John and Tom.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant took prompt measures. The news
from the back trail had affected him sorely. This
same evening he approached the men who were
sitting around the fire. They sprang up, to attention.</p>

<p>“You have heard of the condition of Sparks and
Dougherty,” he addressed. “They must be brought
in at once, with all possible speed.” He paused, as
if planning.</p>

<p>Sergeant Meek saluted.</p>

<p>“One man and myself will take the trip, sir, with
your permission. Jest give us the word, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you, sergeant,” blurted Terry Miller.</p>

<p>“None better,” accepted the sergeant. “We’ll
go on back to the Arkansaw, cap’n, for the hosses.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
And with the hosses we’ll pick up John and Tom,
and if they can’t ride we’ll sling ’em in litters.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pike colored with pleasure.</p>

<p>“That is handsome of you, sergeant; and of you,
Miller. You will march as soon as Stout and
Menaugh get in, and we can make the preparations.
Your volunteering for a journey afoot of almost
two hundred miles over two ranges of mountains
waist deep in snow, at the risk of encountering savages,
and soldiers of a nation that may not be
friendly, is worthy of the uniform that you have
worn.”</p>

<p>“By your leave, sir, there are some others who’d
be proud to share the honor with the sergeant and
Terry,” spoke up Jake Carter, crippled though he
was. “I’ll answer for my feet, sir. They’ll carry
me, once I limber ’em up.”</p>

<p>“Two will be enough. I’m sorry that I can’t
spare more, my man. I see that if you all had your
way you’d leave me without a garrison.”</p>

<p>Sergeant Meek and Terry felt highly tickled at
having got in ahead of the rest.</p>

<p>The next morning Hugh and Freegift arrived
all right. The other two were to start early on the
morrow. Ten pounds of deer meat apiece was all
that might be spared them; they said it was plenty—they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
had to travel light, anyway, and would hunt
as they went.</p>

<p>The lieutenant, with Corporal Jackson, John
Mountjoy and William Gordon and Stub, walked
with them for six miles, so that they might be shown
a better pass for the horses, than the one used by
the corporal. Jerry had reported that his pass was
four feet deep with snow, during three days’ travel.</p>

<p>After the sergeant and Terry had trudged on,
the others killed a deer; Stub and Corporal Jerry
were sent back with it, to the stockade, but the lieutenant
took John and Bill with him, on a farther
scout, down the east side of the main river.</p>

<p>They were gone all day and the night. When
they came in, the next afternoon, they said that they
had discovered fresh signs of men and horses, south.
The lieutenant called the garrison together and issued
strict orders. The two spies had left five days ago;
and if Santa Fe was only two days’ march distant,
soldiers from there were likely to appear at any
moment now.</p>

<p>“We must especially watch out for Indians, my
lads,” he directed. “The tribes hereabouts are
doubtless under the influence of the Spanish government
in New Mexico. When any strangers are
sighted loitering about or passing, you are to retire
unobserved, if possible. If they see you, you are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
not to run, however, nor permit them to approach
you with the idea of disarming you or taking you
prisoner. Should you be unable to evade them, you
are to guard your liberty and bring them to the fort,
where I will attend to them.”</p>

<p>A sentry was posted all day on the top of a hill
at the edge of the stockade prairie, from where he
had a fine view up and down the fork and along the
main river also. During the nights another sentry
kept watch from one of the bastions or little block-houses
on the land-side corners of the stockade.</p>

<p>The stockade had been enclosed by the log walls,
the pickets had been planted, and within a day or two
the outside ditch would be ready for the water.</p>

<p>On February 24 the lieutenant took Stub again
upon another scout and hunt. The two spies had
been gone seven days, and nothing had been heard
from them. He was getting nervous while waiting
for the sergeant and Terry to return with the horses,
Baroney, Pat, and John and Tom. Meat was low;
the men themselves had been too busy to hunt—but
the water was in the ditch and everything was snug
and shipshape.</p>

<p>He and Stub were out two days, scouting eastward,
to examine the traveled road along which the
Spanish might come. They made a circle and arrived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
“home,” lugging the meat of three deer, about nine
o’clock at night.</p>

<p>Corporal Jerry greeted them, after the challenge
of Freegift Stout, who was the guard in the bastion.</p>

<p>“We were beginnin’ to be scared for you, sir,”
he said. “We didn’t know but what the Injuns or
the Spanish had taken you.”</p>

<p>“All quiet here, corporal?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; all quiet.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. We’d have been back sooner,
only we hunted farther than we intended, and had
heavy loads to pack in. Now if the other men with
the horses return in safety, we may all march on
unmolested, through American territory.”</p>

<p>But in the morning, while they were at breakfast,
the musket of John Brown, on the hill, sounded—“Boom!”
It was a signal: “Strangers in sight.”
Corporal Jerry dropped his knife and bolted into a
bastion, to look. Everybody paused, to learn the
news.</p>

<p>Back ran Corporal Jerry, to the lieutenant, who
was standing at the entrance to his brush lean-to,
buckling on his sword.</p>

<p>“Two men are crossin’ the prairie for the fort,
sir. Menaugh (Hugh was the sentinel pacing outside)
is about to stop ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>“See what they have to say. And if there are
no more, admit them,” ordered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Away ran Corporal Jerry, for already Hugh was
calling for the corporal of the guard, while holding
off the two strangers.</p>

<small>IN THE HANDS OF THE SPANIARDS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In a few minutes the two strangers crawled
through the hole. They were clad in blanket-coats and
deer-hide trousers and fur caps; looked like French
traders—and Frenchmen they proved to be, for the
lieutenant called to them, in French, “Come here,”
and he and they talked together in that language.</p>

<p>Stub might catch only a word now and then;
the men listened, puzzled, prepared to grasp their
stacked guns.</p>

<p>The lieutenant finished the conversation. The
Frenchmen bowed politely again, he saluted them
and spoke to his party.</p>

<p>“These are two Frenchmen from Santa Fe,
lads,” he said. “They inform me that the governor
of New Mexico is fearful of an attack upon us by the
Utah Indians, and has sent a detachment of fifty
dragoons for our protection. The detachment is
within two days’ march of us. You know your
duty. I rely upon you to act in a manner that will
reflect credit upon our Country.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken when they all heard
the sentinels outside hailing loudly, with “Halt!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
Who comes there? Corp’ral of the guar-rd! Post
Number One!”</p>

<p>Out dived Corporal Jerry, once more.</p>

<p>“To arms! Man the works, men!” the lieutenant
rapped.</p>

<p>They grabbed guns and hustled for the platforms
under the loopholes. There were more loopholes
than men. Peeping through his, Stub might
see out into the prairie before the stockade. From
up the fork a large body of mounted soldiers had
ridden into the edge of the clearing. John Brown,
who had come in from his hill, and Hugh Menaugh
were holding them back, Corporal Jerry was hastening
to the scene.</p>

<p>The lieutenant also had seen.</p>

<p>“That is the company?” he demanded, of the
two Frenchmen.</p>

<p>“Oui, Monsieur Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“Tell the commander with my compliments to
leave his men in the woods where he now is, and I
will meet him on the prairie before the fort.”</p>

<p>“Oui, oui.”</p>

<p>Out went the two Frenchmen.</p>

<p>“They look like a hundred,” remarked Jake
Carter. “We’re only eight, and an officer an’ a
boy. But what’s the difference?”</p>

<p>“Sure, in case of a dust, Meek and Terry an’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
the rest of ’em will be sorry to miss it,” replied soldier
Mountjoy.</p>

<p>“Hooray for a brush, if that’s the word. We’re
equal to it, no matter how many they send ag’in us.”</p>

<p>The men were keen for a fight. ’Twas a great
thing, thought Stub, to be an American. But the
Spanish soldiers, halted at the edge of the prairie
within short gunshot, looked strong. About fifty, in
one body, were the dragoons; fifty appeared to be a
mixture—a part Indians. But all were well armed
with short muskets, pistols, swords, lances and
shields—some in one style, some in another.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had left and was striding into the
prairie, to meet two Spanish officers. He had taken
only his sword, by his side. That would show his
rank, for his clothes certainly did not. Nevertheless,
the two Spanish officers, all in their heavy crimson
cloaks, and decorated hats, and long boots, did not
look any more gallant than he in his ragged blanket-coat,
torn trousers, moccasins and fur-lined bedraggled
makeshift cap.</p>

<p>The three saluted, and talked for a short time.
Beyond, at the timber, the horses pawed and snorted.
Corporal Jerry and the two sentries stayed, vigilant.
At the loopholes, inside the stockade, the five
men and Stub peered, ready.</p>

<p>Presently one of the Spanish officers shouted a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
command to the soldiers; they relaxed, at ease—some
dismounted, to stretch their legs; he and the other
officer followed Lieutenant Pike to the stockade.</p>

<p>“No fight, hey?” uttered Alex Roy.</p>

<p>“But no surrender, either, you can bet,” grunted
Freegift. “The cap’n likely has something up his
sleeve.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant entered, through the hole; the two
Spanish officers crawled in after—and an odd sight
they made as they straightened up, to stare about
them curiously. It was plain that they were much
astonished by the completeness of the trap.</p>

<p>The lieutenant led the two officers to his brush
shelter. Stub heard his own name called—the lieutenant
beckoned to him. So he jumped down and
went over.</p>

<p>“These two gentlemen of the Spanish army of
New Mexico are to be my guests at breakfast, boy,”
said the lieutenant. “I wish you to serve us. Bring
out the best we have. The provisions given me by
the Indian we met can now be put to good use.”</p>

<p>It was fortunate indeed that the lieutenant had
saved the meal, goose and pieces of bread particularly.
They were a treat—although doubtless the
Spanish soldiers were used to even that fare. At
any rate, most of the stuff soon disappeared, washed
down by water, after the table had been set, so to
speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p>The lieutenant and his guests chatted in French.
When they had finished eating, and the two Spanish
officers had wiped their moustaches with fine white
handkerchiefs, the lieutenant said, crisply:</p>

<p>“Have I the pleasure to understand that this
is a friendly call upon me by his Majesty’s troops, at
the instance of the New Mexico government?”</p>

<p>The elder officer coughed. He answered politely:</p>

<p>“Señor, the Governor of New Mexico, being
informed that you have missed your route, has
ordered me to offer you in his name mules, horses,
money, or whatever you may need, for the purpose of
conducting you to the head of the Red River. From
Santa Fe that is eight days’ journey, before open
to navigation. We have guides and know the
routes.”</p>

<p>“What! Missed my route, sir? Is not this the
Red River?”</p>

<p>“No, señor. This is the Rio Grande del Norte,
of New Mexico. The Red River is many leagues to
the southeast.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant flushed red. His thin hands
clinched, and he gazed bewildered.</p>

<p>“Impossible. Why was I not told this by those
two men ten days ago, and I would have withdrawn?”</p>

<p>The officer twirled his moustache and shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>“Quien sabe (Who knows), Señor Don Lieutenant?
But I now have the honor to inform you, and
am at your service.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant recovered, and stepped outside a
few paces.</p>

<p>“Stout!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Lower the flag and roll it up. It will not be
hoisted again without my orders.”</p>

<p>“Sir?” Freegift stammered. And——</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir! Not that! Not haul down the
flag! Let us keep it flyin’, sir. We can do it.”</p>

<p>Those were the cries. The lieutenant lifted his
hand.</p>

<p>“Silence. I thank you, men. This is not surrender.
I have no thought of surrender. But we
are not upon the Red River. We are upon the Rio
del Norte, in Mexican territory, and in courtesy to
that government I am lowering the flag of my own
free-will. By building this stockade we have unwittingly
trespassed.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[I]</a> All the Rio Grande River which flows southward through
south central Colorado into New Mexico was Spanish territory.
The Lieutenant Pike party had crossed the Sangre de
Cristo Range and had struck the Rio Grande near present
Alamosa in the southern half of Colorado’s great San Luis
Park or Valley. The largest of the White Mountains, on the
east, was Sierra Blanca (“White Mountain” today), altitude
14,390 feet, ranking third among the peaks of the Rockies.
From the camp at the river the Pike men had travelled south,
and built their stockade about five miles up the Conejos
(Rabbits) River, which enters the Rio Grande from the west.
Did he know this to be the Rio Grande del Norte, or did he
really think it to be the Red River? Why did he stop in what
was certainly Spanish territory? Did he wish to be captured?
Or did he only take a chance? Historians have puzzled over
this ever since.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>The men muttered; the two visiting officers sat
uneasy; but Freegift lowered the flag, caught it in his
arms, and with rather a black glance at the red
cloaks folded it carefully.</p>

<p>“By thunder, when we raise it ag’in, it’ll stay,”
he grumbled, as he went to stow it away.</p>

<p>“His Excellency Governor Alencaster requests
the pleasure of a talk with you at Santa Fe, señor,”
said the elder officer, with a smile, to the lieutenant.
“He is desirous of entertaining you and learning
the story of your journey. For your accommodation
he has provided me with one hundred animals, to
carry your baggage.”</p>

<p>“I thank His Excellency, but it is impossible for
me to accept the invitation,” replied Lieutenant Pike,
seating himself again. “I can only send him my
apologies for trespassing, by mistake, upon his domain.
I will wait here merely until the return of
my sergeant and the remainder of my company, and
then withdraw at once to American soil. My orders
forbid me entering into Spanish territory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>“His Excellency will be much distressed not
to see you, señor,” the officer insisted. “I must
beg of you to take advantage of our escort. Otherwise
I cannot answer for your safety.”</p>

<p>At this, the lieutenant straightened, and his eyes
flashed.</p>

<p>“My safety will be attended to, sir. I shall not
move until the safety of my sergeant and party, some
of whom may be suffering, is assured also. Do I
understand that your intent is to use force to convey
me to the governor?”</p>

<p>The officer spread his hands and shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, no, señor! Not in the least. But it is
necessary that for the information of the governor-general
the governor of New Mexico should receive
from you personally an explanation of your presence
within his frontier, that he may send in the proper
report. If you wish to go with us now, very well;
or if you wish to wait for the return of your other
party, very well. But in that case we shall be obliged
to obtain more provisions from Santa Fe, and dispatch
a small number for that purpose.” Even Stub,
who had been listening agog, and catching most of
the words, knew that this meant reinforcements.
“If you decide to march with us now,” the officer
added, “I will leave here an Indian who speaks English,
and a part of my dragoons, to greet your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
sergeant and escort him and his men to join you at
Santa Fe.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant bit his lip and fidgeted. He was
of two minds; but one thing was certain: he could
not get rid of these Spanish without a big fight. And
the worst of that would be, that he was an invader
and had broken the law.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate long.</p>

<p>“I shall not yield to force, sir,” he said. “We
are American soldiers and prepared to defend ourselves,
as you have seen. However, in consideration
of your courteous attitude I am disposed to go with
your escort to His Excellency, and give him the
explanation that is due from one friendly nation to
another. But I must leave two of my men here, to
receive the sergeant and reassure him; otherwise, I
promise you, he will not come on without a fight,
except by direct orders from me.”</p>

<p>“That is agreed, señor,” bowed the officer. “And
we may consider the matter very happily settled.
You have my respectful thanks.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant’s eyes fell upon Stub.</p>

<p>“Tell Stout to send Corporal Jackson in to me.”
He spoke to the Spanish officer. “I will instruct my
men to permit yours to approach, and would suggest
that you inform your company we are willing to
receive them as friends, if their actions so warrant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>“Thanks, señor.”</p>

<p>Stub sought Freegift Stout.</p>

<p>“The lieutenant says for you to tell Jerry to
come in.”</p>

<p>Freegift climbed down.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about? Say! Is it true we’re not
on the Red River yet, but on what they call the Rio
del Norte? Sure, that’s not so.”</p>

<p>“It’s what they say. The lieutenant believes it.
And we’re going to Santa Fe.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“The governor wants to talk with him.”</p>

<p>“But not without a dust! Oh, no, now! Leave
these good works, an’ go without a dust?”</p>

<p>Stub nodded soberly. Freegift dared not delay
longer. He went off muttering. The other men also
murmured. The plan was not to their liking.</p>

<p>Freegift returned with Corporal Jerry. The men
trooped after him, to the lieutenant. Freegift acted
as speaker. He saluted——</p>

<p>“What’s this? Why have you left your posts?”
the lieutenant demanded.</p>

<p>“Please, cap’n. Beggin your pardon, sir—but
’tain’t true, is it, that were layin’ down our arms an’
givin’ up to them Spanish, to march out, an’ no
fight offered? Sure, sir, we’re only eight and a boy;
but we’re behind good walls, an’ you’re the proper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
kind of an officer, an’ ’twould be no great job at all
to hold them fellers off till we could slip away with
colors flyin’. You can’t trust them fellers, sir. An’
if you’ll only give us the orders, sir, we’ll hand out a
dose of Yankee Doodle; eh, boys?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! We’re ready for a dust, cap’n, sir.
We’d rather trust to our muskets than to those
Spanish. We’re not afeared of ’em.”</p>

<p>“That will do,” Lieutenant Pike answered, but
not unkindly. “You’re brave lads. I know I can
depend on you—and with you I’d like to test our
defences at which you’ve worked so faithfully. But
we are marching of our own free will, and shall
retain our arms. My orders are to avoid a conflict
with the Mexican forces, unless attacked. Since we
are unfortunately in Spanish territory, it will be better
if we proceed boldly to the New Mexican capital,
at the invitation of the governor, rather than put
ourselves in the wrong by resistance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. If you say so, sir,” they replied, with
glum faces.</p>

<p>“Corporal, you may draw the sentries in,” continued
the lieutenant “The Spanish soldiers are
to be allowed to move freely outside of the works.
Some of the men may meet them, to treat them
civilly, for I wish no sign of suspicion to be shown.”</p>

<p>The two Spanish officers had gone to their troops.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
A great cheering arose, from that direction, as if the
soldiery had been told that there would be no fighting,
and were heartily glad.</p>

<p>The Spanish flocked forward, into the prairie in
front of the stockade. Freegift and several of the
other men, and Stub, did sally out, curious to inspect
their new friends. The Spanish soldiers were
regular dragoons, fifty; and mounted militia, fifty—a
mixture, these, of Spaniards and Mexicans and
Indians.</p>

<p>And they were kind and friendly, indeed. They
brought food and blankets and insisted that the
Americans accept. Freegift himself finally admitted:</p>

<p>“Well, I’d still prefer a little dust, for the honor
of the army an’ a proof that a half-froze American
is as good a man as a dozen foreigners; but I don’t
deny they’re treatin’ us mighty handsome, the same
as brothers-at-arms. The colors of ’em are a bit
peculiar, yet their hearts seem white.”</p>

<p>Toward noon Corporal Jerry sought out all the
garrison and called them together, inside.</p>

<p>“Mountjoy, you an’ I are to stay here, with
some of the Spanish, an’ a letter from the cap’n to
hand to the sergeant when he comes. The rest of
you are to get ready to march at once. So good luck
to you—an’ we’ll see you later.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p>“That you will,” they answered. “And be sure
you fetch Sparks and Dougherty. They’re the ones
who need all these fine fixin’s.”</p>

<p>Horses were provided, as promised by the Spanish
officer. Riding comfortably on these, and
escorted by fifty of the dragoons and militia and
the two officers (whose names were Lieutenant Don
Ignatio Saltelo and Lieutenant Don Bartholomew
Fernandez), after dinner they rode twelve miles
westward up the fork to the Spanish camp. Now
they numbered only Lieutenant Pike, Privates Freegift
Stout, Alex Roy, Hugh Menaugh, William Gordon,
Jacob Carter, John Brown, and Jack Pursley
otherwise Stub. Corporal Jerry Jackson and Private
John Mountjoy remained at the stockade, with the
other fifty Spanish soldiers, to wait for Sergeant
Meek, and Private Terry Miller, who were bringing
in, across the mountains, John Sparks and Tom
Dougherty (lacking feet and fingers), Baroney Vasquez
and interpreter, Pat Smith, and the horses.</p>

<p>Truly, the little American column had become
much scattered.</p>

<p>“Jinks! I’d like to be there at the reception
and see the sergeant’s face,” Alex Roy chuckled.
“’Specially when he learns we ain’t been on the Red
River at all!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p>“It may seem like a joke, but it’s a rough one,”
quoth William Gordon. “A look at the cap’n’s face
is enough for me. To think, after all these
months he’s never got anywhere. ’Twill be a great
report that he’ll have to turn in, ’less he aims to
l’arn something of the Spanish country. At any
rate, we’ve hauled down our flag, and given up
our fort and I’m sorry for him. He deserved better.”</p>

<small>STUB REACHES END O’ TRAIL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Santa Fe! The city of Santa Fe! Behold!”</p>

<p>Those were the cries adown the delighted column.
Here they were, at last; but this was the evening of
the fifth day since leaving the camp, and the distance
was more than one hundred and sixty miles. The
two spies, who had said that Santa Fe was only
two days’ journey from the stockade, had lied.</p>

<p>The first stage of the trip had been very cold,
in deep snow. Then, on the third day, or March 1,
they had emerged into a country of warmth and
grass and buds, at the first of the Mexican settlements—a
little town named Aqua Caliente or Warm
Springs. Hooray!</p>

<p>They all, the Americans, viewed it curiously.
The houses were low and one-story, of yellowish
mud, with flat roofs; grouped close together so that
they made an open square in the middle of the town
and their rears formed a bare wall on the four sides.</p>

<p>“’Tis like a big brick-kiln, by jinks,” remarked
Freegift. “Now I wonder do they build this way
for fear o’ the Injuns?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>The people here numbered about five hundred—mainly
Indians themselves, but tame Indians, Pueblos
who lived in houses, with a mingling of Mexican
blood. From the house-tops they welcomed the column;
and thronging to meet it they brought out
food and other gifts for the strangers. That night
there was a dance, with the Americans as guests of
honor.</p>

<p>“If this is the way they treat prisoners,” the men
grinned, “sure, though some of us can’t shake our
feet yet, we’re agreeable to the good intentions.”</p>

<p>The same treatment had occurred all the way
down along the Rio Grande del Norte, through a
succession of the flat mud villages. There had been
feasting, dancing, and at every stop the old women
and old men had taken the Americans into the houses
and dressed their frozen feet.</p>

<p>“This feet-washin’ and food-givin’ makes a feller
think on Bible times,” William Gordon asserted.
“The pity is, that we didn’t ketch up with that Spanish
column that was lookin’ for us and gone right
home with ’em for a friendly visit. They’d likely
have put us on the Red River and have saved us
our trouble.”</p>

<p>“Well, we ain’t turned loose yet, remember,”
counseled Hugh Menaugh. “From what I l’arn,
the Melgares column didn’t aim to entertain us with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
anything more’n a fight. But now we’re nicely done,
without fightin’.”</p>

<p>“Yes, this here politeness may be only a little
celebration,” Alex mused. “It’s cheap. For me, I’d
prefer a dust or two, to keep us in trim.”</p>

<p>There had been one bit of trouble, which had
proved that the lieutenant, also, was not to be bamboozled.
In the evening, at the village named San
Juan, or St. John, the men and Stub were together
in a large room assigned to them, when the lieutenant
hastily entered. He had been dining at the priest’s
house, with Lieutenant Bartholomew; but now a
stranger accompanied him—a small, dark, sharp-faced
man.</p>

<p>The lieutenant seemed angry.</p>

<p>“Shut the door and bar it,” he ordered, of John
Brown. Then he turned on the stranger. “We
will settle our matters here,” he rapped, in French;
and explained, to the men: “This fellow is a spy,
from the governor. He has been dogging me and
asking questions in poor English all the way from
the priest’s house. I have requested him to speak
in his own language, which is French, but he understands
English and would pretend that he is a
prisoner to the Spanish—‘like ourselves,’ he alleges.
I have informed him that we have committed no
crime, are not prisoners, and fear nothing. We are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
free Americans. As for you,” he continued, to the
man, roundly, “I know you to be only a miserable
spy, hired by the governor in hopes that you will
win my sympathy and get me to betray secrets. I
have nothing to reveal. But it is in my power to
punish such scoundrels as you”—here the lieutenant
drew his sword—“and if you now make the least
resistance I will use the sabre that I have in my hand.”</p>

<p>“Let us fix him, sir,” cried Hugh, Freegift, and
the others. “We’ll pay him an’ save the governor
the trouble.”</p>

<p>They crowded forward. The dark man’s legs
gave out under him and down he flopped, to his
knees.</p>

<p>“No, señores! For the love of God don’t kill me.
I will confess all.” He was so frightened that his
stammering English might scarcely be understood.
“His Excellency the governor ordered me to ask
many questions. That is true. And it is true that
I am no prisoner. I am a resident of Santa Fe, and
well treated. The governor said that if I pretended
hatred of the country you would be glad of my
help. I see now that you are honest men.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?” the lieutenant demanded.</p>

<p>“Baptiste Lelande, señor, at your service.”</p>

<p>“You can be of no service to me save by getting
out of my sight,” retorted the lieutenant, scornfully,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
and clapping his sword back into its sheath. “You
are a thief, and doubtless depend upon the governor
for your safety. Tell His Excellency that the next
time he employs spies upon us he should choose
those of more skill and sense, but that I question
whether he can find any such, to do that kind of
work. Now begone.”</p>

<p>John Brown opened the door. The man scuttled
out.</p>

<p>“My lads,” spoke the lieutenant, when the door
had been closed again, “this is the second time that
I have been approached by spies, on the march. On
the first occasion I assumed to yield, and contented
the rascal by giving into his keeping a leaf or two
copied from my journal—which in fact merely recounted
the truth as to our number and our setting
forth from the Missouri River. The fellow could
not read, and is treasuring the paper, for the eyes of
the governor. If I am to be plagued this way, I
fear that my baggage or person may be searched, and
my records obtained by our long toil be stolen. Accordingly
I shall trust in you, knowing that you will
not fail me. I have decided to distribute my important
papers among you, that you may carry them
on your persons, out of sight.”</p>

<p>So he did.</p>

<p>“They’ll be ready for you when you want ’em,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
cap’n, sir,” Freegift promised, as the men stowed
the papers underneath their shirts. “If the Spanish
want ’em, they’ll have to take our skins at the same
time.”</p>

<p>“That they will,” was the chorus.</p>

<p>“To the boy here I consign the most important
article of all,” pursued the lieutenant, “because he
is the least likely to be molested. It is my journal
of the whole trip. If that were lost, much of our
labors would have been thrown away. I can rely
on you to keep it safe, Stub?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” And Stub also stowed away his
charge—a thin book with stained red covers, in which
the lieutenant had so frequently written, at night.</p>

<p>“We will arrive at Santa Fe to-morrow, lads,”
the lieutenant had warned. “And if my baggage is
subjected to a search by order of the governor, I
shall feel safe regarding my papers.”</p>

<p>Presently he left.</p>

<p>“Lalande, the nincompoop was, was he?” remarked
Jake Carter. “Well, he got his come-upments.
But ain’t he the same that the doctor was
lookin’ for—the sly one who skipped off with a
trader’s goods?”</p>

<p>“So what more could be expected, than dirty
work, from the likes!” Hugh proposed.</p>

<p>The lieutenant fared so heartily at the priest’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
house that this night he was ill. In the morning,
which was that of March 3, they all had ridden on
southward, led by him and by the pleasant Don
Lieutenant Bartholomew. They had passed through
several more villages, one resembling another; and in
the sunset, after crossing a high mesa or flat tableland
covered with cedars, at the edge they had
emerged into view of Santa Fe, below.</p>

<p>“Santa Fe! La ciudad muy grande (The great
city)! Mira (See)!”</p>

<p>Those were the urgent exclamations from the
dragoons and militia.</p>

<p>“‘Great city,’ they say?” Hugh uttered, to Stub.
“Huh! Faith, it looks like a fleet o’ flatboats, left
dry an’ waitin’ for a spring rise!”</p>

<p>It was larger than the other villages or towns,
and lay along both flanks of a creek. There were
two churches, one with two round-topped steeples;
but all the other buildings were low and flat-roofed
and ugly, ranged upon three or four narrow crooked
streets. At this side of the town there appeared to
be the usual square, surrounded by the mud buildings.
Yes, the two-steepled church fronted upon it.</p>

<p>As they rode down from the mesa, by the road
that they had been following, the town seemed to
wake up. They could hear shouting, and might see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
people running afoot and galloping horseback, making
for the square.</p>

<p>A bevy of young men, gaily dressed, raced,
ahorse, to meet the column. The whole town evidently
knew that the Americans were coming. The
square was filled with excited men, women and children,
all chattering and staring.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bartholomew cleared the way through
them, and halted in front of a very long, low building,
with a porch supported on a row of posts made
of small logs, and facing the square, opposite the
church. He swung off. The dragoons and militia
kept the crowd back.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pike, in his old clothes, swung off.</p>

<p>“Dismount!” he called. “We are to enter here,
lads. Bear yourselves boldly. We are American
soldiers, and have nothing to fear.”</p>

<p>He strode on, firm and erect, following the guidance
of Lieutenant Bartholomew.</p>

<p>“Keep together,” Freegift cautioned; and the
men pushed after, trying not to limp, and to carry
their army muskets easily. Stub brought up the
tail of the little procession. He, too, was an American,
and proud of it, no matter how they all looked,
without hats, in rags and moccasins, the hair of
heads and faces long.</p>

<p>They entered the long-fronted building. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
doorway was a full four feet thick. The interior
was gloomy, lighted by small deep-set windows with
dirty panes. There was a series of square, low-ceilinged
rooms—“’Tis like a dungeon, eh?” Freegift
flung back—but the earth floors were strewn with the
pelts of buffalo, bear, panther, what-not.</p>

<p>They were halted in a larger room, with barred
windows and no outside door. Lieutenant Bartholomew
bowed to Lieutenant Pike, and left. Against
the walls there were several low couches, covered
with furs and gay blankets, for seats. So they sat
down, and the men stared about.</p>

<p>“Whereabouts in here are we, I wonder,” John
Brown proposed.</p>

<p>“Did ye see them strings o’ tanned Injun ears
hangin’ acrost the front winders!” remarked Hugh
Menaugh.</p>

<p>“Sure, we’d never find way out by ourselves,”
declared Alex Roy. “It’s a crookeder trail than
the one to the Red River.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant briefly smiled; but he sat
anxiously.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bartholomew suddenly returned;
close behind him a large, heavy-set, swarthy, hard-faced
man, of sharp black eyes, and dressed in a
much decorated uniform. Lieutenant Pike hastily
arose, at attention; they all rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>“His Excellency Don Joaquin del Real Alencaster,
Governor of the Province of New Mexico,”
Lieutenant Bartholomew announced. “I have the
honor to present Lieutenant Don Mungo-Meri-Paike,
of the American army.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pike bowed; the governor bowed, and
spoke at once, in French.</p>

<p>“You command here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” The lieutenant answered just as
quickly.</p>

<p>“Do you speak French?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You come to reconnoiter our country, do you?”</p>

<p>“I marched to reconnoiter our own,” replied
Lieutenant Pike.</p>

<p>“In what character are you?”</p>

<p><a href="#i_298">“In my proper character, sir: an officer of the
United States army.”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_298">

  </div>
</div>

<p>“And the man Robinson—is he attached to your
party?”</p>

<p>“No.” The governor’s voice had been brusque,
and the lieutenant was beginning to flush. But it was
true that the doctor was only an independent
volunteer.</p>

<p>“Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He is from St. Louis.”</p>

<p>“How many men have you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>“I had fifteen.” And this also was true, when
counting the deserter Kennerman.</p>

<p>“And this Robinson makes sixteen?” insisted
the governor.</p>

<p>“I have already told your Excellency that he
does not belong to my party,” the lieutenant retorted.
“I shall answer no more enquiries on the
subject.”</p>

<p>“When did you leave St. Louis?”</p>

<p>“July 15.”</p>

<p>“I think you marched in June.”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” snapped the governor. “Return
with Don Bartholomew to his house, and come here
again at seven o’clock and bring your papers with
you.”</p>

<p>He shortly bowed, whirled on his heels and left.
The lieutenant bit his lips, striving to hold his temper.
Lieutenant Bartholomew appeared distressed.</p>

<p>“A thousand apologies, Don Lieutenant,” he
proffered. “His Excellency is in bad humor; but
never mind. You are to be my guest. Your men
will be quartered in the barracks. Please follow me.”</p>

<p>They filed out, through the rooms, into daylight
again.</p>

<p>“A sergeant will show your men, señor. They
are free to go where they please, in the city,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
Lieutenant Bartholomew. “My own house is at
your service.”</p>

<p>“Go with Lieutenant Bartholomew’s sergeant,
lads,” Lieutenant Pike directed. “Guard your
tongues and actions and remember your duty to your
Government.”</p>

<p>Beckoning with a flash of white teeth underneath
his ferocious moustache the dragoon sergeant took
them to the barracks. These were another long
building on the right of the first building, fronting
upon the west side of the square and protected by a
wall with a court inside.</p>

<p>At a sign from the sergeant they stacked their
muskets and hung their pistols, in the court. Then
they were led in to supper.</p>

<p>“Sure, we’re goin’ to be comfortable,” Freegift
uttered, glancing around as they ate. “The food is
mighty warmin’—what you call the seasonin’? Pepper,
ain’t it, same as we got, above? Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear what they call that other buildin’,
where we were took first?” asked Jake Carter, of
Stub.</p>

<p>“The Palace of the Governors, the soldiers said.”</p>

<p>“Palace!” Jake snorted. “It’s more like the
keep of a bomb-proof fort. I’ve dreamed of palaces,
but never such a one. There’s nothin’ for a governor
to be so high and uppish about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>“The cap’n gave him tit for tat, all right,”
asserted William Gordon. “We’ve got a verse or
two of Yankee Doodle in us yet!”</p>

<p>They finished supper and shoved back their cowhide
benches.</p>

<p>“We’re to go where we plaze, ain’t it?” queried
Hugh. “So long as we keep bounds? Well, I’m
for seein’ the town whilst I can.”</p>

<p>“We’re with you, old hoss,” they cried, and
trooped into the court.</p>

<p>First thing, they found that their guns had
vanished.</p>

<p>Freegift scratched his shaggy head.</p>

<p>“Now, a pretty trick. We’re disarmed. They
come it over us proper, I say.”</p>

<p>Spanish soldiers were passing to and fro. Some
stared, some laughed, but nobody offered an explanation
or seemed to understand the questions.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t in the bargain, was it?” Alex Roy
demanded. “The cap’n’ll have a word or two of the
right kind ready, when he learns. Anyhow, we’ll
soon find out whether we’re prisoners as well.
Come on.”</p>

<p>The gate at the entrance to the court was open.
The guard there did not stop them. They had
scarcely stepped out, to the square, when loitering
soldiers and civilians, chatting with women enveloped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
in black shawls, welcomed them in Spanish
and beckoned to them, and acted eager to show them
around.</p>

<p>“‘Buenas noches,’ is it? ‘Good evenin’ to ye,’”
spoke Freegift. “I expect there’ll be no harm in
loosenin’ up a bit. So fare as you like, boys, an’
have a care. I’m off. Who’s with me?”</p>

<p>They trooped gaily away, escorted by their new
Santa Fean friends. Stub stuck to Freegift, for a
time; but every little while the men had to stop, and
drink wine offered to them at the shops and even at
the houses near by; so, tiring of this, he fell behind,
to make the rounds on his own account and see what
he chose to see.</p>

<p>He was crossing the bare, hard-baked square,
or plaza as they called it, to take another look at
the strings of Indian ears festooned on the front of
the Governor’s Palace, when through the gathering
dusk somebody hailed him.</p>

<p>“Hi! Muchacho! Aqui! (Hi! Boy! Here!)”</p>

<p>It was Lieutenant Bartholomew, summoning him
toward the barracks. The lieutenant met him.</p>

<p>“Habla Español (You speak Spanish)?”</p>

<p>“Very little,” Stub answered.</p>

<p>“Bien (Good).” And the lieutenant continued
eagerly. “Como se llama Ud. en Americano (What
is your name in American)?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>“Me llamo Jack Pursley (My name is Jack
Pursley), señor.”</p>

<p>“Si, si! Bien! Muy bien! (Yes, yes! Good!
Very good!)” exclaimed the lieutenant. “Ven
conmigo, pues (Come with me, then).”</p>

<p>On he went, at such a pace that Stub, wondering,
had hard work keeping up with him. They made a
number of twists and turns through the crooked,
darkened streets, and the lieutenant stopped before
a door set in the mud wall of a house flush with
the street itself. He opened, and entered—Stub on
his heels. They passed down a narrow verandah, in
a court, entered another door——</p>

<p>The room was lighted with two candles. It had
no seats except a couple of blanket-covered couches
against its wall; a colored picture or two of the saints
hung on the bare walls. A man had sprung up. He
was a tall, full-bearded man—an American even
though his clothes were Spanish.</p>

<p>He gazed upon Stub; Stub gaped at him.</p>

<p>“It is the boy,” panted Lieutenant Bartholomew.
“Bien?”</p>

<p>“Jack!” shouted the man.</p>

<p>“My dad!” Stub blurted.</p>

<p>They charged each other, and hugged.</p>

<p>“Good! Good!” exclaimed the lieutenant, dancing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
delighted. Several women rushed in, to peer
and ask questions.</p>

<p>“Boy, boy!” uttered Jack’s father, holding him
off to look at him again. “I thought never to see
you, after the Utes got you. They took you somewhere—I
couldn’t find out; and finally they fetched
me down to Santa Fe, and here I’ve been near two
years, carpentering.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you get away?”</p>

<p>“No. They won’t let me. And now I’m mighty
glad.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m here, too,” laughed Stub. “And I
guess I’ll stay; but I’ll have to ask Lieutenant Pike.”</p>

<p>“He’s gone to the palace, to talk with the
governor again. You and I’ll talk with each other.
I came especially to see him; thought maybe he might
help me, and I hoped to talk with one of his kind.
American blood is powerful scarce in Santa Fe.
There’s only one simon-pure Yankee, except myself.
He’s Sol Colly; used to be a sergeant in the army
and was captured six years ago along with the rest
of a party that invaded Texas. But he doesn’t live
here. A Frenchman or two, here from the States,
don’t count. My, my, it’s good to speak English
and to hear it. As soon as the lieutenant learnt
my name he remembered about you; but he couldn’t
wait, so Don Bartholomew went to find you. Now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
you’ll go home with me, where we can be snug and
private.”</p>

<p>He spoke in Spanish to Lieutenant Bartholomew,
who nodded.</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly, señor. Until to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>And Jack gladly marched home hand-in-hand
with his father, James Pursley, of Kentucky, the discoverer
of gold in Colorado, and the first American
resident in Santa Fe.</p>

<small>GOOD-BY TO LIEUTENANT PIKE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The lieutenant and men were to be sent clear
to the city of Chihuahua, more than six hundred
miles southward, where the commanding general
of all Mexico had headquarters.</p>

<p>An officer and two soldiers from Governor Alencaster
had called for him again in the morning immediately
after breakfast. He returned to the Lieutenant
Bartholomew house fuming. Stub never before
had seen him so angry.</p>

<p>“I protested with all my power,” he related, to
Lieutenant Bartholomew and Stub’s father. “I
said that I should not go unless forced to by military
strength. The governor agreed to give me a paper
certifying to the fact that I march only as compelled
to, but our detention as prisoners is a breach
of faith. I consented to come to Santa Fe, for the
purpose of explaining to him my accidental presence
within his frontiers; and I have so explained.
He has even read my papers and my commission.
Now he orders us still further into the interior.”</p>

<p>“You have my sympathy, señor,” proffered Lieutenant
Bartholomew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p>“That’s the system here, sir,” added Stub’s
father. “I am an American citizen, and was brought
in by the Injuns, from outside territory; and I can’t
leave without a permit. I’m close watched—but I’ve
still got my old rifle; and give me two hours’ start
and I’ll not ask for any other passport.”</p>

<p>“When I reminded His Excellency that my unintentional
trespass was not to be compared with his,
when he dispatched five hundred troops far into
the Pawnee country, well within the territory of
the United States, he had no reply,” pursued Lieutenant
Pike. “However, I am to dine with him this
noon, and march soon thereafter, to meet an escort
under that Lieutenant Melgares below.”</p>

<p>“You will find Don Facundo Melgares to be a
very pleasant gentleman, señor,” spoke Lieutenant
Bartholomew.</p>

<p>“He spent a great deal of time and money
looking for me,” Lieutenant Pike grimly laughed.
“He might as well have stayed here, for I should
never have yielded to him, north of the Red River;
not while I had a man left. I understand that
Doctor Robinson, whom the governor mentioned,
also has been sent south.”</p>

<p>“That is possible, señor.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“And I suppose my sergeant and the other men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
will follow me.” He turned to Stub. “Come, boy;
we’ll look up our party and order them to be ready.
Their arms are to be restored to them, at least. We’re
not to be driven like cattle. His Excellency has
promised that, and we’ll march as soldiers.”</p>

<p>“You take the boy to Chihuahua?” queried
Lieutenant Bartholomew.</p>

<p>“What?” Stub’s tall father demanded, with a
start.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pike smiled.</p>

<p>“No, sir. He remains here, where he belongs.
I am only too happy to have reunited him and his
father. His service with me ends—and it has been
a greater service than you may imagine.”</p>

<p>They hastened for the barracks. Midway, the
lieutenant halted in covert of an old wall.</p>

<p>“You have my journal?” he asked, guardedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good! You may give it to me, now. Quick!
There!” He swiftly tucked it away. “It is the
only paper unknown to the governor, and I mean
to keep it. Last night, when I considered that he
was done with me, I heard that the men were drinking
wine with the town people. So in case they
should drink too much I sought them out and took
the other papers from them. They’re faithful, but
the wine might have made them careless. I stowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
the papers in my trunk again (this was a little hand-trunk
that the lieutenant had carried, with help,
from the Arkansaw, as his only important baggage);
then early this morning the governor unexpectedly
sent for me and my trunk and I had no chance to
open it privately. By trusting in him I was cleverly
outwitted, but thanks to you I’ve saved my journal.
Had I found you last night I would have taken
it, to place it with the other papers.”</p>

<p>So, thanks to a boy, the journal of Lieutenant
Pike was saved to the world.</p>

<p>“Can’t you get your trunk again?” Stub asked,
as they hurried on.</p>

<p>“It will go down to Chihuahua with me, but in
charge of the officer of the escort, for the commanding
general.”</p>

<p>“Do the papers tell anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“No, unless they are wrongly read. There are
letters, and scientific notes upon the locations and
distances; and maps. If the commanding general
thinks we were spying out the country, he may try
to keep everything. But the journal would be the
greatest loss.”</p>

<p>And truth to say, Lieutenant Pike never did get
back any of the papers in the trunk.</p>

<p>Freegift and John Brown were at the barracks;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
the other men were rambling about. John went to
find them.</p>

<p>“To Chihuahua is it, sir?” Freegift gasped.
“Without our guns?”</p>

<p>“You will get your guns.”</p>

<p>“An’ don’t we wait for the sergeant an’ them
others, sir?”</p>

<p>“We’re not permitted. I’ll leave a note for
Meek with this boy, here, telling him to keep up
courage and follow us.”</p>

<p>“But doesn’t the lad go, too, sir?”</p>

<p>“No. He stays in Santa Fe.”</p>

<p>“I’ve found my father, Freegift,” eagerly explained
Stub. “He’s here. The Utahs brought him
here. I’ve got to stay with him.”</p>

<p>“Found your dad, eh? Well, well! An’ good!
I want to know! That’s all right, then. We’ve been
some worried over you, but sure we felt sartin you
wouldn’t desert. Expect you’d rather have found
your father than the Red River; hey?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Stub stammered. “I wish we’d
found both.”</p>

<p>His heart ached for Lieutenant Pike, who seemed
to have found nothing—unless he really had intended
to come here.</p>

<p>“We soldiers must not complain; we will only
rejoice in your good fortune, my lad,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
the lieutenant. “All in all, we did not toil in vain,
and we have done what we could. Have the men
ready to march at twelve o’clock, Stout.” And
turning on his heel he strode off.</p>

<p>“A fine little man, an’ a smart one,” mused
Freegift, gazing after. “We’ll go with him to
Chihuahua—an’ to the ends o’ the earth, if need be.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant left first, shortly after noon. He
had dined with the governor; when he came out of
the palace, into the public square, prepared to start,
the governor’s coach was waiting, attached to six
gaily harnessed mules. A detachment of dragoons
also were waiting; so were Stub and his father, and
old Sergeant Colly who had been captured, six years
ago, in Spanish territory.</p>

<p>They shook hands with the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Good-by. Good-by, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good-by.” He held his head high, like an
officer and a free American. He did not mind the
stares of the town people. “Remember, you are
Americans.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget us, sir, when you reach the States,”
old Solomon Colly implored. “Don’t forget Sergeant
Colly of the army, who made his only mistake
when he was trapped by these Spanish. You’ll do
what you can for us, sir?”</p>

<p>“I’ll not forget; not while I have breath in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
body,” promised the lieutenant, earnestly. “I will
report you to the Government.”</p>

<p>The governor had clumped out, in his uniform
and jack-boots. Lieutenant Bartholomew, and Captain
D’Almansa who was to command the escort
southward, were with him. They all entered the
splendid coach decorated with gilt.</p>

<p>The door slammed. The servant climbed to the
seat beside the driver—the sergeant in charge of the
dragoons shouted an order, and away they went,
mules and horses at a gallop.</p>

<p>That was the last that Stub or anybody in Santa
Fe ever saw of young Lieutenant Pike.</p>

<p>Stub went to the barracks with his father and
Solomon Colly, to watch the men off. They were
about to go. He shook hands with them, too: with
Freegift, and Alex Roy, and John Brown, and Hugh
Menaugh, and William Gordon, and Jake Carter—that
brave six, still limping from frozen feet.</p>

<p>“Good luck to you, boy.”</p>

<p>“Good luck.”</p>

<p>“An’ never forget you’ve been a Pike man, on
one o’ the toughest marches in history,” added Freegift.
“Stick up for your country. You’ve l’arned
never to say die—an’ that’s the American of it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I know it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, lads, but Sol and I wish we were going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
with you,” sighed his father. “But maybe you’ll
be back again, by the thousand, and then we’ll see
the flag floating.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. There’ll be a time,” replied Freegift.
“There’ll be a time when the flag’ll float over this
very spot. But we won’t need any thousand. Five
hundred of us under Cap’n Pike could take the whole
country. An’ now we know a way in.”</p>

<p>“I’ve half a notion that the lieutenant wasn’t so
sorry to be made prisoner, after all,” Stub’s father
remarked to him, on the way home. “There’s something
secret about this that he doesn’t tell. As that
soldier friend of yours said, in case of war—and
war over this borderland dispute is likely to break
out any day—the army will know what’s ahead of it.”</p>

<p>“They’ll let Lieutenant Pike go, won’t they?”</p>

<p>His father chuckled.</p>

<p>“They’ll have to. He’s not the kind of man
they can keep. They can’t prove he’s a spy, for he’s
in uniform (what there is of it), and his orders are
plain to read.”</p>

<p>This day was March 4. It was two weeks later,
or March 18, when at last Lieutenant Saltelo brought
in Sergeant Meek and Corporal Jerry Jackson, Terry
Miller, John Mountjoy, poor John Sparks and Tom
Dougherty, Baroney, Pat Smith and the few miserable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
horses and the main baggage. There was great
rejoicing, again, in Santa Fe.</p>

<p>Sergeant Meek was taken at once to Governor
Alencaster, but ’twas safe to say that the governor
would find out little from <em>him</em>. Stub sought the
other men out, at the barracks. John Sparks and
Tom were unable to walk; they had lost their feet,
and the most of their fingers; Baroney and Pat, and,
they said, the sergeant, too, were in bad shape, from
the march through the snows, to the stockade; but
they all welcomed Stub.</p>

<p>“Where’s the cap’n?”</p>

<p>“He’s gone to Chihuahua.”</p>

<p>“And what are ye doin’ here, then? Did you
run off from him? Say!”</p>

<p>“No. He told me to stay. I found my father.
We’re living here—till we can get away.”</p>

<p>“You did? Found your father! Want to
know! Hooray! And the cap’n and the rest to
Chihuahua. So it’s to Chihuahua the same for us,
no doubt.”</p>

<p>“Faith, that’s proper,” declared Tom Dougherty.
“We’ll not desert him. If it be prison for wan
of us let it be prison for all of us. What’s left
o’ me’ll stick to the cap’n. Sure, John an’ me are
only poor cripples—whether we’ll be paid I don’t
know; but all we want is to be with him, doin’ as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
we can. He’s had the hardest luck an’ he complained
not wance.”</p>

<p>When Sergeant Meek came, Stub gave him the
note. The sergeant read it.</p>

<p>“The cap’n says for us to keep our arms, and not
lose the baggage. Yes, that’s the caper. Bear in
mind, lads. We’re for Chihuahua in the morning.”</p>

<p>They, also, were sent down to Chihuahua. Stub
never saw any of them again, either. He heard, much
later, that the lieutenant and six had safely reached
Natchitoches; but from Chihuahua no word ever
came back of Sergeant Meek, Corporal Jerry,
Baroney the interpreter, Privates Sparks, Dougherty,
Mountjoy, Miller, and Pat Smith, except that
General Salcedo, the commander, had found them
a hard lot to handle and had got them out of his
province as quickly as he might.</p>

<p>So probably they caught up with Lieutenant Pike
somewhere in the United States; and as likely as not
some of them were with him to support him when
he fell, dying on the field of battle, away north in
Canada, during the War of 1812.</p>

<p>They all loved him.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
